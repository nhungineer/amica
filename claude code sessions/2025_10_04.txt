> I want to build Amica, a sophisticated meetup coordination agent with async multi-user state management.

Context:
- Full PRD is in docs/PRD.md
- UI mockups are in design/mockups/ 
- Previous CrewAI agent work is in reference/crewai-baseline/

Learning objectives:
- Understand full-stack development with mentoring approach
- Learn async state management for multi-user coordination
- Learn git fundamentals as we build
- Explain architectural decisions - I learn best understanding "why" not just "how"

Think hard about the optimal development sequence starting with schema design for async multi-user state management. Create a detailed development plan 
that breaks this into learning-focused phases. 

⏺ I'll help you build Amica with a mentoring approach focused on understanding architectural decisions. Let me first explore the PRD, mockups, and
  existing code to create a comprehensive development plan.

⏺ Analysis Complete! Here's the Learning-Focused Development Plan

  Why Start with Schema Design?

  The schema is your app's contract with reality. In a multi-user async app, you have a critical challenge: multiple people's actions happening at 
  different times need to coordinate toward a shared goal. Your schema defines:

  1. What state needs to persist (between user sessions)
  2. Who owns what (permissions/isolation)
  3. How changes propagate (one person's RSVP affects everyone's view)
  4. When the agent acts (triggers based on state transitions)

  Think of it like designing a shared whiteboard before people start writing on it. If you don't plan the structure, you get chaos.

  ---
  Phase 1: Schema Design & Database Foundation (Learning: Data modeling, async state)

  Core Entities & Why They Matter:

  User
  ├─ id, email, name, auth_provider
  └─ WHY: Identity anchor. Every action needs attribution.

  Gathering 
  ├─ id, organizer_id, title, location, time_options[], rsvp_deadline
  ├─ status: "collecting_rsvps" | "analyzing" | "recommended" | "confirmed"
  └─ WHY: The coordination context. Status drives agent triggers.

  GatheringParticipant (join table)
  ├─ gathering_id, user_id, status: "invited" | "responded" | "declined"
  ├─ availability[], budget, cuisine_prefs[], dietary_restrictions[]
  └─ WHY: Multi-user state lives here. One person's response doesn't 
          overwrite another's. Agent needs ALL responses to analyze.

  AgentRun
  ├─ id, gathering_id, agent_type, status, input, output, created_at
  └─ WHY: Audit trail + Resume capability. If agent fails, you can retry
          without losing context. Shows users "what the AI is doing."

  VenueRecommendation
  ├─ id, agent_run_id, gathering_id, venue_data{}, match_score, reasoning
  └─ WHY: Separates agent output from gathering state. Multiple runs can
          create different recommendations without clobbering each other.

  Key Design Decision: Why Separate AgentRun from Gathering?

  Option A (Bad): Store agent output directly on GatheringProblem: One agent run overwrites previous. No history. Can't show "why did the agent pick
  this?"

  Option B (Good): Separate AgentRun tableBenefits:
  - History of all agent attempts (great for debugging)
  - Can show users "The agent ran 3 times, here's why it changed recommendations"
  - Easy retry logic if agent fails
  - Clear audit trail for learning/debugging

  This is async state management 101: Separate events (AgentRun) from current state (Gathering).

  ---
  Phase 2: Git Fundamentals (Learning: Version control as we build)

  We'll learn git just-in-time as we need it:

  Week 1-2 concepts:
  - git status: "What changed?" (after every coding session)
  - git add: "Mark this for saving" (stage files)
  - git commit: "Save a checkpoint with a message" (commit with why, not what)
  - Why: Checkpoints let you experiment safely. Break something? Rewind to last commit.

  Week 3-4 concepts:
  - git branch: "Create a parallel universe to try risky changes"
  - git checkout: "Switch between universes"
  - git merge: "Bring changes from experiment back to main"
  - Why: Keeps stable code separate from experiments. Crucial for learning.

  Later:
  - git log: History of your decisions
  - git diff: "What exactly changed between two points?"

  We'll create commits together after each feature, discussing what message captures the "why."

  ---
  Phase 3: Backend Architecture (Learning: APIs, async jobs, event-driven design)

  Technology Stack (and Why):

  Node.js + TypeScript
  - Why: Type safety helps beginners catch errors before runtime. TS makes the codebase self-documenting.

  PostgreSQL
  - Why: Relational database perfect for multi-user coordination. Transactions prevent race conditions (two people RSVPing at same time).

  Prisma ORM
  - Why: Schema-first design. You define schema, Prisma generates type-safe database client. Less SQL to write initially.

  tRPC or REST API
  - Why: Type-safe API between frontend/backend. Great for learning because editor shows you what's available.

  BullMQ (job queue)
  - Why: Agent runs take time (10-30 seconds). Can't block user's browser. Queue lets you "start job → show loading → notify when done."

  API Design (Event-Driven):

  POST /gatherings/create
  → Creates gathering, sends invites (async email job)

  POST /gatherings/:id/rsvp
  → User submits preferences
  → Check: "Is this the last person or past deadline?"
  → If yes: Trigger agent workflow (async job)

  GET /gatherings/:id/status
  → Real-time status: "2/5 responded" or "Agent analyzing..." or "Here are recommendations"

  POST /agent-runs/:id/approve
  → Organizer approves venue → Booking flow (future phase)

  Why event-driven? User actions trigger state changes trigger agent actions. This mirrors real-world async coordination.

  ---
  Phase 4: Frontend (React/Next.js) (Learning: State management, optimistic updates)

  Why Next.js:

  - Server components: Some data fetching happens server-side (faster initial load)
  - Built-in routing: File system = routes (less config for beginners)
  - API routes: Can start with backend in same project, split later

  State Management Approach:

  React Query (TanStack Query)
  - Why: Perfect for async server state. Auto-refetches when data changes. Shows loading/error states automatically.

  Optimistic Updates Example:
  User clicks "Submit RSVP"
  → Immediately show "✓ Your response is recorded" (optimistic)
  → Send to server in background
  → If fails, revert + show error

  Why: Makes app feel instant even with network delay. Critical for good UX.

  Key Learning: Server State vs Client State

  Server state: Who has RSVP'd, agent recommendations
  - Lives in database, multiple users share it
  - Use React Query to fetch/cache

  Client state: "Is this dropdown open?", form inputs before submit
  - Only this user's browser cares
  - Use React hooks (useState)

  Mixing these is the #1 beginner mistake.

  ---
  Phase 5: Agent Integration (Learning: LLM orchestration, error handling)

  Migrating from CrewAI to Production:

  CrewAI Baseline Limitations:
  - Synchronous (blocks while running)
  - No database persistence
  - No error recovery
  - Single-user simulation

  Production Agent Architecture:

  Job Queue (BullMQ)
    ↓
  Agent Orchestrator
    ├─ Step 1: Analyze preferences (LLM call)
    │   Save to AgentRun table → Status "analyzing_preferences"
    │
    ├─ Step 2: Search venues (Google Places API)
    │   Save results → Status "searching_venues"
    │
    ├─ Step 3: Match & rank (LLM call with venues + preferences)
    │   Save to VenueRecommendation → Status "completed"
    │
    └─ If error at any step: Status "failed", save error message
        User sees: "Agent encountered an issue, please review preferences"

  Why this structure:
  - Each step saves state → Can resume if server crashes
  - User sees progress: "Agent is analyzing preferences..."
  - Failed runs don't lose data (stored in AgentRun)
  - Easy to add human-in-loop ("Agent needs your input on X")

  LLM Call Design:

  Structured outputs (not raw text):
  const preferencesAnalysis = await llm.generate({
    prompt: buildPreferencesPrompt(allRSVPs),
    schema: z.object({
      availabilityConsensus: z.string(),
      budgetRange: z.object({ min: z.number(), max: z.number() }),
      cuisinePreferences: z.array(z.string()),
      conflicts: z.array(z.string())
    })
  })

  Why schemas: Ensures agent output is parseable. Can't get "Agent returned gibberish and crashed."

  ---
  Phase 6: Real-Time Features (Learning: WebSockets, subscriptions)

  When person #3 RSVPs, person #1 (the organizer) should see "3/5 responded" without refreshing.

  Options:

  Short polling (beginner-friendly):
  Every 5 seconds: GET /gatherings/:id/status
  Update UI if changed
  Why start here: Simple, easy to debug, works for v1.

  WebSockets (later):
  Server pushes updates when state changes
  Browser receives "gathering_updated" event → UI updates
  Why later: More complex, but better UX. Learn after mastering basics.

  Next Steps: Your Decision

  Before we write any code, I want to make sure you're comfortable with this plan. Here's what I recommend:

  Option A (Schema-First): Start by designing the database schema together. I'll explain each table/field, you ask questions until it makes sense. Then
  we implement it.

  Option B (Prototype-First): Build a simple "hello world" API + React app first to understand the stack, then tackle schema design.

  Option C (Explore Baseline): Dig into the CrewAI code together, run it, understand what it does, then plan how to evolve it.

  Which resonates with you? Or do you have questions about any part of this plan?

> This plan is too expansive for my timeline. I have 4 weeks maximum to build a working prototype to learn core concepts, it doesn't need to be 
production grade and polish. Can you revise the plan? I agree on starting with schema first. 

⏺ Revised 4-Week Prototype Plan

  You're right - let's cut to the essentials. Here's what you'll learn with a working prototype:

  ---
  Core Learning Goals (4 weeks)

  1. Schema design for multi-user async state
  2. API fundamentals (CRUD operations)
  3. Agent integration (async workflow)
  4. Basic frontend (forms + displaying data)
  5. Git basics (commit, branch, merge)

  ---
  Simplified Stack (Fewer Moving Parts)

  Backend:
  - Node.js + Express (simpler than tRPC for learning)
  - PostgreSQL + Prisma (same - good foundation)
  - No auth: Just email input (no passwords, no OAuth)
  - No job queue: Agent runs synchronously (user waits 30 seconds - fine for prototype)

  Frontend:
  - React (Vite) - Not Next.js (one less concept)
  - Basic fetch calls - No React Query yet
  - Minimal CSS - Function over form

  What We're Cutting:
  - ❌ Authentication/authorization
  - ❌ Email notifications (just show link to copy)
  - ❌ Real-time updates (refresh page to see changes)
  - ❌ Deployment (runs on localhost)
  - ❌ Error recovery/retry logic
  - ❌ UI polish

  ---
  Minimal Schema (3 Core Tables)

  User
  ├─ id (uuid)
  ├─ email
  └─ name

  Gathering
  ├─ id (uuid)
  ├─ organizer_id → User
  ├─ title (e.g., "Brunch in Melbourne")
  ├─ location
  ├─ time_options (json: ["Sat 11 Oct", "Sun 12 Oct"])
  ├─ rsvp_deadline (datetime)
  ├─ status ("collecting" | "completed")
  └─ agent_output (json, nullable) - stores final recommendation

  Response (instead of GatheringParticipant)
  ├─ id
  ├─ gathering_id → Gathering
  ├─ user_id → User
  ├─ availability (json: ["Sat 11 Oct"])
  ├─ budget_max (number)
  ├─ cuisine_prefs (json: ["Italian", "Japanese"])
  └─ dietary_restrictions (text)

  Why simpler:
  - No separate AgentRun table (store output on Gathering for now)
  - No VenueRecommendation table (embed in agent_output)
  - Status is binary (collecting vs done) - no intermediate states

  Trade-off: Less audit trail, but 80% of learning value with 30% of complexity.

  POST /gatherings/create
    → Creates gathering, returns ID + shareable link

  GET /gatherings/:id
    → Returns gathering details + all responses

  POST /gatherings/:id/respond
    → User submits their preferences
    → Check if all responses in → trigger agent

  GET /gatherings/:id/recommendations

  Submit → POST /gatherings/create
  Show: "Share this link: localhost:3000/g/abc123"

  Days 3-5: Response Flow + Results
  /g/:id → Shows gathering details
  Form: Availability, Budget, Cuisine, Dietary needs
  Submit → POST /gatherings/:id/respond
  Show: "Thanks! 2/5 people have responded"

  If status=completed → Show recommendations

  Learning: React components, forms, state, routingGit: Frontend work in frontend branch

  ---

  - Frontend calls backend APIs
  - Test full flow: Create → Share → 3 people respond → Agent runs → See results
  - Fix bugs

  Days 3-4: Handle Edge Cases
  - What if agent fails? Show error message
  - What if someone changes response? (Update, re-run agent)
  - What if 0 people respond? (Don't run agent)

  Day 5: Demo Prep
  - Seed realistic data
  - Test with friends (share link, have them RSVP)
  - Document what you learned

  Learning: Integration, debugging, manual testingGit: Merge all branches, tag v1.0

  ---
  What You'll Have After 4 Weeks

  ✅ Working prototype: Create gathering → Friends respond → Agent recommends venues✅ Understanding of multi-user state management✅ Experience with
  full-stack development✅ Git fundamentals (commit, branch, merge)✅ Agent integration (LLM + external APIs)✅ Foundation to add polish later (auth,
  real-time, deployment)

  ---
  What's NOT Included (Add Later If You Want)

  - Authentication (anyone can access any gathering via link)
  - Email notifications (manually share links)
  - Real-time updates (refresh to see changes)
  - UI polish (basic HTML forms, minimal CSS)
  - Deployment (runs on localhost only)
  - Error recovery (if agent fails, manually retry)

  ---
  Let's Start: Schema Design Session

  I'll walk you through designing each table. For each field, I'll explain:
  - What it stores
  - Why we need it
  - How it's used in the app

  Then you ask questions until it clicks. Sound good?

  We'll start with the User table - the simplest one. Ready?

> I still think that authentication is still critical  for the app. Can we use email only indentification for the first 3 weeks  and add oAuth later? 
Also what would I understand more from agentic work perspective? 

⏺ Great Points! Let me revise:

  ---
  Email Authentication (Simple & Secure Enough)

  Week 1 approach:
  When user creates gathering or responds:
  → Enter email + name
  → Store in User table (or find existing)
  → Save user_id in browser cookie/localStorage
  → That's it - no password, no verification yet

  Why this works:
  - ✅ User attribution (who created what, who responded)
  - ✅ Prevents accidental overwrites (each response tied to user)
  - ✅ Realistic (tracks who's who)
  - ✅ Easy upgrade path (add password/OAuth in week 4 if time)

  Week 4 upgrade (optional):
  - Magic link via email: Click link → auto-login
  - Or simple OAuth with Google/Apple

  Trade-off: Someone could put fake email initially, but for prototype testing with friends it's fine.

  ---
  What You'll Learn: Agent Work Perspective

  This is the core learning value - let me break down what's different from typical API integration:

  1. Multi-Agent Orchestration (Not Just "Call OpenAI")

  Traditional API:                Agent Workflow:
  User asks question         →    State change triggers workflow
  Call LLM once              →    Step 1: Preference Agent analyzes
  Return answer              →    Step 2: Venue Agent searches
                             →    Step 3: Ranking Agent matches
                             →    Each step uses previous output

  Learning: How to chain agents where each agent has a specific role and output of one feeds the next.

  ---
  2. Structured Outputs (Reliability)

  Problem: LLMs return text. Your app needs data structures.

  What you'll learn:
  // Bad: Pray the LLM returns valid JSON
  const result = await llm.generate("Analyze these preferences...")
  const parsed = JSON.parse(result) // Might crash!

  // Good: Enforce structure with schema
  const result = await llm.generate({
    prompt: "Analyze preferences...",
    response_format: {
      budget_range: { min: number, max: number },
      consensus_cuisines: string[],
      availability_overlap: string,
      conflicts: string[]
    }
  })
  // Guaranteed to match schema or retry

  Why critical: Agents in production can't return gibberish. You'll learn how to make LLM outputs parseable and predictable.

  ---
  3. Tool Use / Function Calling

  Traditional: You manually call Google Places APIAgent approach: LLM decides when to call it and with what parameters

  Preference Agent outputs:
  → "Group wants Italian or Japanese, budget $20-30, Sunday 10am-12pm"

  Venue Agent receives this + has access to tool:
  → LLM decides: "I should search for 'Italian restaurants' near
     'Melbourne' with price_level=2"
  → Calls Google Places API with those params
  → Receives venues
  → Ranks them based on preference match

  Learning: How to give agents tools and let them decide when/how to use them. This is core to modern agent frameworks.

  ---
  4. Context Management (Memory)

  Challenge: Agent needs to "remember" all RSVPs to make good decisions.

  You'll build:
  - Short-term memory: Current gathering's responses
  - Long-term memory (future): User always prefers vegetarian

  What you'll learn:
  // Building agent context
  const agentContext = {
    gathering: gathering,
    responses: allResponses, // All RSVPs
    venue_data: googlePlacesResults,
    constraints: {
      must_accommodate_all: true,
      budget_max: maxBudgetFromResponses
    }
  }

  // Agent uses this to make informed decisions

  ---
  5. State-Based Triggers (When Does Agent Act?)

  Not: User clicks "run agent"But: System detects conditions → auto-triggers agent

  You'll implement:

  When response submitted:
    ↓
  Check: response_count === invitee_count
    OR current_time > rsvp_deadline?
    ↓
  If YES → Trigger preference analysis agent
    ↓
  Preference agent completes
    ↓
  Auto-trigger venue search agent
    ↓
  Venue agent completes
    ↓
  Update gathering.status = "completed"

  Learning: Event-driven agent orchestration - agents react to state changes, not manual triggers.

  ---
  6. Human-in-the-Loop (Escalation)

  Scenario: Agent finds no venues matching all criteria.

  What you'll build:
  Agent detects conflict:
  → "Budget range is $20-30 but all 3 people want different cuisines
     with no overlap. Unable to find consensus."

  → Update gathering.status = "needs_review"
  → Show organizer: "We need your help resolving conflicts"
  → Organizer manually picks compromise
  → Agent re-runs with override

  Learning: When to let agents decide vs escalate to humans. This is crucial for real-world agent systems.

  ---
  7. Iterative Refinement (Self-Correction)

  Advanced concept you can add in Week 4:

  Venue Agent completes:
    ↓
  Ranking Agent evaluates output:
    "Do these 3 venues actually match the criteria?"
    ↓
  If confidence < 80% → Flag for organizer review
  If confidence > 80% → Auto-approve

  Learning: Agents checking other agents' work - multi-agent collaboration pattern.

  ---
  Concrete Agent Learning Outcomes

  By Week 4, you'll understand:

  ✅ Orchestration: How to chain multiple agent steps✅ Structured outputs: How to make LLM responses reliable✅ Tool calling: How agents use external
  APIs based on decisions✅ Context building: What information agents need to make good choices✅ Triggers: When to run agents automatically vs manual✅
  Error handling: What to do when agents fail or disagree✅ Human oversight: When to escalate vs let agent decide✅ State management: How agent outputs
  change app state

  This is different from "I called an LLM API" - you're building a multi-agent coordination system.

  ---
  Does this timeline + agent learning focus make sense? Ready to start with schema design?

> Excellent. Let's dive into the schema design. 

⏺ Perfect! Let's start with the foundation. We'll design each table together, and I'll explain the reasoning behind every decision.

  ---
  Table 1: User

  This is your identity table - every person who interacts with Amica gets a record here.

  User
  ├─ id               (UUID, primary key)
  ├─ email            (string, unique)
  ├─ name             (string)
  ├─ created_at       (timestamp)
  └─ updated_at       (timestamp)

  Field-by-Field Breakdown:

  id - UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
  - What: A unique string like "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  - Why UUID vs auto-incrementing number?
    - Security: Can't guess other user IDs (with numbers: if you're user 100, user 101 exists)
    - Distributed systems: If you later split database, UUIDs don't collide
    - Shareable links: /g/550e8400... is less guessable than /g/1
  - Trade-off: Slightly larger storage, but worth it for security

  email - String, unique
  - What: User's email address
  - Why unique constraint?
    - Prevents duplicate accounts ("sarah@email.com" can only exist once)
    - Email becomes the natural identifier humans use
    - Enables "find existing user by email" when they RSVP to multiple gatherings
  - How it's used:
    - When creating gathering: Check if organizer email exists → use existing User or create new
    - When responding: Same check → ties all responses to same User

  name - String
  - What: Display name (e.g., "Sarah Chen")
  - Why separate from email?
    - Email is for identity (technical)
    - Name is for display (human-friendly)
    - Shows "Sarah responded" instead of "sarah.chen@gmail.com responded"
  - Could we derive this from email?
    - No - "sarah.chen@gmail.com" → is name "Sarah" or "Sarah Chen"? Better to ask.

  created_at / updated_at - Timestamps
  - What: When user was first created / last modified
  - Why?
    - Debugging ("When did this user first show up?")
    - Future features: "You've been using Amica since Oct 2025"
    - Audit trail (when did they change their name?)
  - Automatic: Database sets these, you don't manually update

  ---
  Questions to Consider:

  1. Should we store timezone? (for displaying times correctly)
    - My take: Not yet - adds complexity. Assume all users in same city for prototype.
  2. Should we store preferences globally? (e.g., "always vegetarian")
    - My take: Not yet - store per-response. Add in v2 if needed.
  3. What about phone number for SMS?
    - My take: Out of scope for 4 weeks. Email-only.

  ---
  Does the User table make sense? Any questions before we move to Gathering?

> Makes sense and agreed with your recommendations to descope. Question on email and UUID. If the same email address use the system, say 
sarah.chen@email.com it will be merged to just one ID (UUID) in the database? I assume they can use different names if they wanted to per session? 

⏺ Excellent question! You're thinking about the behavior, not just the structure. Let me clarify:

  ---
  Email + UUID Relationship

  Scenario: sarah.chen@email.com interacts twice

  First interaction (creates a gathering):
  Check database: Does email "sarah.chen@email.com" exist?
  → No
  → Create new User:
     id: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"  (generated UUID)
     email: "sarah.chen@email.com"
     name: "Sarah"

  Second interaction (RSVPs to friend's gathering):
  Check database: Does email "sarah.chen@email.com" exist?
  → Yes! Found id: "550e8400-..."
  → Reuse that User record
  → Don't create duplicate

  Result: Same email → Same UUID across all gatherings/responses

  ---
  What About the Name?

  You asked: "Can they use different names per session?"

  Two options:

  Option A: Name lives on User table (simpler)

  First time: name = "Sarah"
  Second time: they enter "Sarah Chen"
  → UPDATE User SET name = "Sarah Chen"
  → All past responses now show "Sarah Chen"

  Trade-off:
  - ✅ Simpler data model
  - ✅ Consistent identity across all gatherings
  - ❌ Can't have different names for different friend groups

  Option B: Name per Response (more flexible)

  User table: just id + email (no name)
  Response table: user_id + display_name

  Same person could be:
  - "Sarah C" in work gathering
  - "Sarah Chen" in family gathering

  Trade-off:
  - ✅ Flexibility per context
  - ❌ More complex (name scattered across responses)
  - ❌ Gathering organizer also needs name stored somewhere

  ---
  My Recommendation for Prototype:

  Go with Option A (name on User table, updates each time)

  Why:
  - Simpler to implement
  - Most people use consistent name
  - If they type "Sarah" once and "Sarah Chen" later, updating is fine
  - Edge case (wanting different names) is rare for friend gatherings

  Code behavior:
  // When user enters email + name
  const user = await findOrCreateUser({
    email: "sarah.chen@email.com",
    name: "Sarah Chen"  // Updates name if user exists
  })

  // findOrCreateUser logic:
  // 1. Find by email
  // 2. If found: update name (if different) + return existing
  // 3. If not found: create new with generated UUID

  This means:
  - ✅ Same email = same UUID forever
  - ✅ Name can change (overwrites previous)
  - ✅ Email is the permanent identifier, name is just display

  ---
  Production Consideration (Not for Prototype):

  In a real app, you might:
  - Store name on User but also display_name on Response (with default to User.name)
  - Track name changes: "Sarah updated their name from 'Sarah' to 'Sarah Chen'"
  - Let users have a "profile name" vs "display name per gathering"

  But for 4 weeks: Simple update on User table is perfect.

  ---
  Does that clarify the email-UUID-name relationship? Ready to move to the Gathering table?

> Yes, that makes sense. A user can relate to the gathering either as a host/organiser or an invitee/participant. Where is this informations stored? In a
 different database that joins gathering and user? Sorry, I think this should be my last question before we move on to Gathering  table 

⏺ Perfect question! You're thinking exactly like a database designer. This is about relationships between tables.

  ---
  How Users Relate to Gatherings

  You're right - there are two different relationships:

  1. Organizer Relationship (One-to-Many)

  Stored in: Gathering table directly

  Gathering
  ├─ id
  ├─ organizer_id  ← Foreign key pointing to User.id
  ├─ title
  └─ ...

  What this means:
  - One User can organize many Gatherings
  - Each Gathering has exactly one organizer
  - No separate table needed - just a column that references User

  Example data:
  Gathering #1: organizer_id = "550e8400..." (Sarah's UUID)
  Gathering #2: organizer_id = "550e8400..." (Sarah's UUID)
  Gathering #3: organizer_id = "abc-123..." (Bob's UUID)

  Sarah organized 2 gatherings, Bob organized 1.

  ---
  2. Participant Relationship (Many-to-Many)

  Stored in: Response table (acts as a join table)

  Response
  ├─ id
  ├─ gathering_id  ← Foreign key to Gathering
  ├─ user_id       ← Foreign key to User
  ├─ availability
  ├─ budget_max
  └─ ...

  What this means:
  - One User can respond to many Gatherings (as a participant)
  - One Gathering can have many Users responding
  - The Response table connects them + stores their preferences

  Example data:
  Response #1: gathering_id=G1, user_id=Amy, availability=[Sat]
  Response #2: gathering_id=G1, user_id=Bob, availability=[Sun]
  Response #3: gathering_id=G2, user_id=Amy, availability=[Fri]

  Amy is a participant in G1 and G2. Bob is a participant in G1.

  ---
  Visual Diagram

  User (Sarah)
    |
    | organizer_id (stored in Gathering)
    ↓
  Gathering #1 "Brunch in Melbourne"
    ↑
    | gathering_id (stored in Response)
    |
    ├─ Response (Amy)    ← user_id points back to User (Amy)
    ├─ Response (Bob)    ← user_id points back to User (Bob)
    └─ Response (Charlie)

  Sarah's role: Organizer (via Gathering.organizer_id)Amy/Bob/Charlie's role: Participants (via Response.user_id)

  ---
  Why Response Table = Join Table + Data

  In database design, a join table (also called "junction table") connects two tables in a many-to-many relationship.

  Simple join table (minimal):
  GatheringParticipant
  ├─ gathering_id
  └─ user_id

  But we need more than just "who's invited" - we need their preferences!

  So Response table is a rich join table:
  Response
  ├─ gathering_id       ← Join table part
  ├─ user_id            ← Join table part
  ├─ availability       ← Extra data
  ├─ budget_max         ← Extra data
  ├─ cuisine_prefs      ← Extra data
  └─ dietary_restrictions ← Extra data

  This is a common pattern: Join table that also carries meaningful information.

  ---
  Key Insight

  You don't need a separate table to track "who's a participant" - the existence of a Response record means they're a participant!

  To find all participants of Gathering #1:
  SELECT user_id FROM Response WHERE gathering_id = 'G1'

  To find all gatherings Amy participated in:
  SELECT gathering_id FROM Response WHERE user_id = 'Amy-UUID'

  ---
  Edge Case: What if someone is invited but hasn't responded yet?

  Option A (prototype approach): No Response record = not tracked
  - Organizer manually shares link, we don't pre-create invitations
  - Response only exists after they submit the form

  Option B (production approach): Separate Invitation table
  Invitation
  ├─ gathering_id
  ├─ user_id (or just email if they're not in system yet)
  └─ status: "pending" | "responded" | "declined"

  Then Response links to Invitation

  For 4 weeks: Option A is fine. We won't pre-populate invitations.

  ---
  Does the relationship structure make sense now? Ready for the Gathering table design?

> Makes sense, the nuance is one to one, one to many, where to store it and when to use a rich join table like the response table! Let's go into the 
Gathering table schema  design 

⏺ Perfect! You've got the core concept. Now let's design the heart of the system - the Gathering table.

  ---
  Table 2: Gathering

  This table represents a single coordination event - one instance of "friends trying to meet up."

  Gathering
  ├─ id                   (UUID, primary key)
  ├─ organizer_id         (UUID, foreign key → User.id)
  ├─ title                (string)
  ├─ location             (string)
  ├─ time_options         (JSON array)
  ├─ rsvp_deadline        (timestamp)
  ├─ status               (enum: "collecting" | "completed" | "failed")
  ├─ agent_output         (JSON, nullable)
  ├─ created_at           (timestamp)
  └─ updated_at           (timestamp)

  ---
  Field-by-Field Breakdown:

  id - UUID
  - Same pattern as User
  - Used in shareable links: https://amica.app/g/abc-123...
  - Non-guessable for privacy

  organizer_id - UUID, Foreign Key → User.id
  - What: References the User who created this gathering
  - Why foreign key?
    - Database enforces: Can't have organizer_id that doesn't exist in User table
    - Can't delete a User if they've organized gatherings (protects data integrity)
  - Relationship: One-to-Many
    - One User can organize many Gatherings
    - Each Gathering has exactly one organizer
  - How it's used:
    - Display "Sarah's brunch gathering"
    - Determine who can edit/cancel the gathering

  title - String
  - What: Human-friendly name ("Brunch in Melbourne", "Team dinner")
  - Why needed?
    - Multiple gatherings can be in same location ("Melbourne")
    - Organizer might create 2 brunches different weekends
    - Shows in email/notifications: "You're invited to: Team dinner"

  location - String
  - What: Search area for venues ("Brunswick, VIC", "Downtown Seattle")
  - Why string, not structured address?
    - Flexibility: User might type "near my office" or "South Melbourne"
    - Agent + Google Places API can geocode it
    - Don't need precision for search radius
  - Prototype simplicity: Just text input
  - Production upgrade: Could use Google Places Autocomplete widget → store place_id

  time_options - JSON Array
  - What: Array of possible times/dates organizer offers
  - Example: ["Sat 11 Oct 10am-12pm", "Sun 12 Oct 10am-12pm"]
  - Why JSON instead of separate TimeOption table?

  - Option A (separate table):
  TimeOption
  ├─ id
  ├─ gathering_id
  └─ time_slot (string)
    - More "normalized" (database design principle)
    - Query: "Give me all time options for gathering X"

  Option B (JSON array - what we're doing):
  time_options: ["Sat 11 Oct", "Sun 12 Oct"]
    - Simpler: Always loaded with Gathering (1 query not 2)
    - Time options don't have their own lifecycle (never edit just one)
    - Lightweight for prototype

  Trade-off: Less queryable ("find all gatherings on Saturday") but we don't need that query.

  rsvp_deadline - Timestamp
  - What: When to stop waiting for responses and run the agent
  - Why needed?
    - Trigger logic: if (all_responded OR now > deadline) → run agent
    - Prevents gathering from hanging indefinitely if 1 person never responds
    - User sets: "I need recommendations by Friday evening"
  - Example: 2025-10-10T18:00:00Z (Oct 10, 6pm UTC)
  - How agent uses it:
    - Cron job checks every hour: "Are there gatherings past deadline with status='collecting'?"
    - If yes → trigger agent even if not everyone responded

  status - Enum (limited set of values)
  - What: Current state of the gathering in the workflow
  - Possible values:
    - "collecting" - Waiting for responses
    - "completed" - Agent ran successfully, recommendations ready
    - "failed" - Agent encountered error
  - Why enum vs string?
    - Database enforces valid values (can't accidentally set status="done" instead of "completed")
    - Type-safe in code (TypeScript knows exactly which values are valid)
  - How it drives the app:
  if status === "collecting":
    → Show "2/5 people responded, waiting for others..."

  if status === "completed":
    → Show agent recommendations

  if status === "failed":
    → Show "Something went wrong, please review responses"
  - State transitions:
  Creating gathering → status = "collecting"
  Last response received → status = "completed" (after agent runs)
  Agent crashes → status = "failed"

  agent_output - JSON, Nullable
  - What: The agent's final recommendations (stored as structured data)
  - Why JSON?
    - Agent returns complex nested data:
    {
    "preference_analysis": {
      "budget_range": { "min": 20, "max": 30 },
      "consensus_cuisines": ["Italian", "Japanese"],
      "availability": "Sunday 10am-12pm"
    },
    "venue_recommendations": [
      {
        "name": "Nicholson St Roasters",
        "address": "131 Sydney Rd, Coburg",
        "rating": 4.4,
        "price_level": 2,
        "match_score": 0.92,
        "reasoning": "Matches budget, has vegetarian options..."
      },
      {...}, {...}
    ]
  }
    - Flexible structure (agent output might evolve)
    - Frontend can parse and display however it wants
  - Why nullable?
    - When status="collecting" → agent_output is null (hasn't run yet)
    - When status="completed" → agent_output has data
    - When status="failed" → might be null or contain error info
  - Prototype simplification:
    - Could store in separate VenueRecommendation table
    - But JSON on Gathering is simpler for 4 weeks
    - Easy to evolve to separate table later if needed

  created_at / updated_at - Timestamps
  - Auto-managed by database
  - Useful for:
    - Sorting: "Show most recent gatherings first"
    - Debugging: "When was this created vs when did responses come in?"
    - Cleanup: "Delete gatherings older than 30 days"

  ---
  Design Decisions Explained

  Why JSON for time_options and agent_output?

  Pros:
  - ✅ Flexible schema (agent output structure can change)
  - ✅ Fewer tables (simpler joins)
  - ✅ Atomic operations (load everything in 1 query)
  - ✅ Fast for prototype

  Cons:
  - ❌ Can't query inside JSON easily ("find gatherings with Italian in recommendations")
  - ❌ No schema validation at database level (could store any JSON)
  - ❌ If JSON gets huge, slow to load

  For Amica: Pros outweigh cons. These fields are:
  - Loaded as a unit (always need full array/object)
  - Not frequently queried by content
  - Reasonably sized (time_options: ~5 items, agent_output: ~3 venues)

  Why status enum instead of booleans?

  Bad approach:
  is_collecting (boolean)
  is_completed (boolean)
  is_failed (boolean)
  Problems: Could have is_collecting=true AND is_completed=true (invalid state!)

  Good approach (enum):
  status = "collecting" | "completed" | "failed"
  - Mutually exclusive (can only be in one state)
  - Easy to add states later ("pending_approval", "cancelled")
  - Clear state transitions

  ---
  Questions to Consider:

  1. Should we store invitee emails on Gathering?
  invited_emails: ["amy@email.com", "bob@email.com"]
    - My take: Not for prototype. We know invitees from Response table.
    - Production: Maybe, to track "invited but haven't responded yet"
  2. Should we store participant_count explicitly?
  expected_participants: 5
    - My take: No, can calculate from Response count
    - Avoids "source of truth" problem (what if count doesn't match actual responses?)
  3. Should status include "cancelled"?
    - My take: Yes, add it! "collecting" | "completed" | "failed" | "cancelled"
    - Organizer should be able to cancel

  ---
  Does the Gathering table structure make sense? Any questions before we design the Response table?

> Yes, that all makes sense. Thanks for talking me through the pros and cons of json approach. As for questions to consider, agree with you for the 3 
recommendations, esp the cancelled status. Let's go to the rich joint table for Response 
  ⎿  Session limit reached ∙ resets 12pm

> Yes, that all makes sense. Thanks for talking me through the pros and cons of json approach. As for questions to consider, agree with you for the 3 
recommendations, esp the cancelled status. Let's go to the rich joint table for Response 

⏺ Excellent! Now for the most important table from an agent perspective - this is where the multi-user coordination data lives.

  ---
  Table 3: Response

  This is the rich join table that connects Users to Gatherings AND stores their preferences for the agent to analyze.

  Response
  ├─ id                      (UUID, primary key)
  ├─ gathering_id            (UUID, foreign key → Gathering.id)
  ├─ user_id                 (UUID, foreign key → User.id)
  ├─ availability            (JSON array)
  ├─ budget_max              (integer, nullable)
  ├─ cuisine_preferences     (JSON array)
  ├─ dietary_restrictions    (text, nullable)
  ├─ additional_notes        (text, nullable)
  ├─ created_at              (timestamp)
  └─ updated_at              (timestamp)

  ---
  Field-by-Field Breakdown:

  id - UUID
  - Each response is a distinct entity
  - Allows editing: "User changed their response" creates update, not new row
  - Can reference specific response: "See Amy's preferences"

  gathering_id - UUID, Foreign Key → Gathering.id
  - What: Links this response to a specific gathering
  - Relationship: Many-to-One
    - Many responses belong to one gathering
    - Each response belongs to exactly one gathering
  - Database enforcement:
    - Can't create response for gathering_id that doesn't exist
    - Deleting a gathering deletes all its responses (cascade delete)
  - How it's used:
    - Query: "Get all responses for this gathering" → agent analyzes them
    - Count: "3 out of 5 people responded"

  user_id - UUID, Foreign Key → User.id
  - What: Links this response to who submitted it
  - Relationship: Many-to-One
    - Many responses can come from one user (across different gatherings)
    - Each response belongs to exactly one user
  - How it's used:
    - Display: "Amy: Available Saturday, Budget $25"
    - Prevent duplicates: "Has this user already responded to this gathering?"

  IMPORTANT: Compound Unique Constraint
  UNIQUE(gathering_id, user_id)
  - What: Each user can only submit ONE response per gathering
  - Why: Prevents duplicate responses
    - User refreshes page and submits again → UPDATE existing response, don't create new
  - Database enforces: Trying to insert second response for same user+gathering → error
  - Application behavior:
  // Upsert pattern (update or insert)
  await db.response.upsert({
    where: {
      gathering_id_user_id: { gathering_id: "G1", user_id: "U1" }
    },
    update: { availability: ["Saturday"], budget_max: 30 },
    create: { gathering_id: "G1", user_id: "U1", ... }
  })

  ---
  availability - JSON Array
  - What: Which time_options from Gathering this user can attend
  - Example:
  ["Sat 11 Oct 10am-12pm", "Sun 12 Oct 10am-12pm"]
  - How it works:
    - Gathering has: time_options: ["Sat 11 Oct", "Sun 12 Oct", "Mon 13 Oct"]
    - Amy selects: ✅ Sat, ✅ Sun (available both days)
    - Bob selects: ✅ Sun only
    - Charlie selects: ✅ Sat only
    - Agent analyzes: "Sat and Sun both work for 2/3 people, no overlap with all 3"
  - Why array, not separate table?
    - Availability always loaded with response (atomic unit)
    - Small dataset (max ~5 time slots)
    - Simpler queries: Load response → have all availability
  - Agent perspective:
  // Preference analysis agent
  const responses = await getResponses(gathering_id)

  // Find overlapping availability
  const allAvailability = responses.map(r => r.availability).flat()
  const timeCounts = countOccurrences(allAvailability)
  const bestTime = findMostPopular(timeCounts)

  // "Sunday 10am-12pm works for 4/5 people"

  budget_max - Integer, Nullable (in dollars)
  - What: Maximum this person wants to spend per person
  - Example: 30 (means $30)
  - Why integer?
    - Simpler than decimal for prototype (no $29.99)
    - Agent does math: min(all_budgets) and max(all_budgets) → range
  - Why nullable?
    - Some users might not have budget preference ("I'm flexible")
    - null means "no constraint"
  - Agent perspective:
  const budgets = responses
    .map(r => r.budget_max)
    .filter(b => b !== null)

  const budgetRange = {
    min: Math.min(...budgets),  // 20
    max: Math.max(...budgets)   // 40
  }

  // Agent searches for venues in $20-40 range
  // OR if too broad, uses median: $30

  cuisine_preferences - JSON Array
  - What: Types of food this person wants
  - Example:
  ["Italian", "Japanese", "Mediterranean"]
  - Why array?
    - Most people like multiple cuisines
    - Agent needs to find overlap
  - Agent perspective:
  // Flatten all cuisine preferences
  const allCuisines = responses
    .map(r => r.cuisine_preferences)
    .flat()

  // Count occurrences
  const counts = {
    "Italian": 3,      // 3 people want Italian
    "Japanese": 2,     // 2 people want Japanese
    "Mexican": 1
  }

  // Agent prioritizes: Search for Italian restaurants first
  // Backup: Japanese if no good Italian options
  - Why not predefined list (dropdown)?
    - Prototype: Free text is simpler
    - Production: Could use autocomplete with common cuisines + "Other"

  dietary_restrictions - Text, Nullable
  - What: Free-form dietary needs
  - Example:
  "Vegetarian, gluten-free"
  "Nut allergy"
  null (no restrictions)
  - Why text, not structured?
    - Dietary needs are diverse and nuanced
    - "Pescatarian but only sustainable seafood" → hard to model as checkboxes
    - Agent (LLM) is good at understanding natural language
  - Agent perspective:
  const restrictions = responses
    .map(r => r.dietary_restrictions)
    .filter(r => r !== null)

  // Agent prompt:
  "The group has these dietary restrictions:
   - User 1: Vegetarian, gluten-free
   - User 3: Nut allergy

   Find venues that can accommodate ALL of these."
  - Why nullable? Most people don't have restrictions

  additional_notes - Text, Nullable
  - What: Catch-all for anything else
  - Example:
  "I need to leave by 1pm"
  "Prefer outdoor seating"
  "Can't do venues with stairs (wheelchair)"
  - Why needed?
    - Users always have edge cases you didn't plan for
    - Better to capture than force into wrong field
    - Agent can interpret: "One person mentioned wheelchair access, prioritize accessible venues"
  - Agent perspective:
    - Passes to LLM as context
    - LLM decides if it's important: "outdoor seating" might not be dealbreaker, "wheelchair access" is

  created_at / updated_at - Timestamps
  - created_at: When user first responded
  - updated_at: When they last changed their response
  - Why both?
    - Track: "Amy responded 2 days ago, then updated yesterday"
    - Agent timing: "All responses submitted within 24 hours of deadline"
    - Debugging: "Did Amy change her budget after seeing others' responses?"

  Key Design Patterns in Response Table

  1. Join Table + Rich Data

  Not just:
  gathering_id, user_id  ← Connects the entities

  But also:
  + availability, budget, cuisines, restrictions  ← The coordination data

  Why this matters:
  - Response IS the participation record
  - No separate "Participant" table needed
  - All coordination data in one place

  2. Agent-First Design

  Every field answers: "What does the agent need to coordinate this meetup?"

  - availability → Find time overlap
  - budget_max → Set price constraints
  - cuisine_preferences → Search filters
  - dietary_restrictions → Must-have accommodations
  - additional_notes → Edge case handling

  This table is optimized for agent input, not just data storage.

  3. Flexibility via JSON + Text

  Structured fields: gathering_id, user_id, budget_maxFlexible fields: availability (array), cuisines (array), restrictions (text)

  Why mix?
  - Foreign keys need structure (referential integrity)
  - Preference data benefits from flexibility (users are unpredictable)
  - Agent (LLM) handles unstructured data well

  ---
  Critical Database Constraint

  UNIQUE(gathering_id, user_id)

  Without this:
  Response 1: gathering=G1, user=Amy, budget=20
  Response 2: gathering=G1, user=Amy, budget=30  ← Duplicate!
  Agent gets confused: "Does Amy want $20 or $30?"

  With this:
  First submit → INSERT
  Second submit → UPDATE (replaces previous response)
  Agent always sees one response per person.

  ---
  Questions to Consider:

  1. Should we track response "status" (pending/submitted/withdrawn)?
    - My take: Not for prototype. Existence of Response = submitted.
    - Production: Maybe add status if you want "invited but not responded" tracking
  2. Should budget be a range (min/max) per person?
    - My take: Just max is simpler. Assume min is $0 or reasonable default.
    - Edge case: "I want to spend at least $50" is rare
  3. Should availability be timestamps instead of strings?
    - Prototype: Strings like "Sat 11 Oct" are easier
    - Production: Proper datetime ranges for timezone handling
  4. What if someone wants to decline the gathering entirely?
    - Option A: Don't create Response (absence = declined)
    - Option B: Add status: "accepted" | "declined" field
    - My take: Option A for prototype (simpler)

  ---
  Does the Response table make sense? Ready to review the full schema with all relationships?

> Most of it makes sense but I'd like to push back on having date/time as string, that seems incredibly dangerous. Given that we can use UI to force 
structured input, wouldn't it make sense to store it as proper timestamp? Timezone wise it can be associated with the gathering location, not user 
specific. I think string for time input is bad news, so many different interpretation. If we could force date through calendar picker, and time with time
 picker with range, that should be better? What am I missing? 

⏺ You're absolutely right! This is excellent critical thinking. String dates are a disaster waiting to happen. Let me revise.

  ---
  Why Strings Are Dangerous

  Problems you identified:
  - ❌ "Sat 11 Oct" - Which year? 2025? 2026?
  - ❌ "10am-12pm" vs "10:00 AM" vs "10-12" - Parsing chaos
  - ❌ No timezone info - Is "10am" in Melbourne time? User's local time?
  - ❌ Can't validate: Database accepts "Blurgsday 99 Octember"
  - ❌ Can't query: "Find gatherings in the next 7 days" requires string parsing
  - ❌ Agent gets messy data: Has to interpret "Sat" vs "Saturday" vs "2025-10-11"

  You're missing nothing - this is a real problem I oversimplified!

  ---
  Revised Approach: Structured Timestamps

  Gathering Time Options (Organizer Sets)

  Instead of:
  time_options: ["Sat 11 Oct 10am-12pm", "Sun 12 Oct 10am-12pm"]

  Use:
  time_options: [
    {
      "start": "2025-10-11T10:00:00+11:00",  // ISO 8601 with timezone
      "end": "2025-10-11T12:00:00+11:00",
      "label": "Sat 11 Oct 10am-12pm"         // Display only
    },
    {
      "start": "2025-10-12T10:00:00+11:00",
      "end": "2025-10-12T12:00:00+11:00",
      "label": "Sun 12 Oct 10am-12pm"
    }
  ]

  Why this structure:
  - ✅ start/end: Machine-readable timestamps with timezone
  - ✅ label: Human-readable for display (optional, can generate from timestamps)
  - ✅ Timezone included: +11:00 is Melbourne (AEDT)
  - ✅ Unambiguous: Year, month, day, hour, minute, timezone all explicit

  ---
  Response Availability (User Selects)

  Instead of:
  availability: ["Sat 11 Oct", "Sun 12 Oct"]

  Use: Array of IDs or references to time_options

  Option A (Simple - Reference by Index):
  available_time_slots: [0, 1]  // Indexes into gathering.time_options
  - User checks: ✅ Sat, ✅ Sun
  - Stores: [0, 1] (first and second option)
  - Agent queries: gathering.time_options[0] → gets full timestamp

  Option B (Robust - Store Full Timestamps):
  available_time_slots: [
    {
      "start": "2025-10-11T10:00:00+11:00",
      "end": "2025-10-11T12:00:00+11:00"
    },
    {
      "start": "2025-10-12T10:00:00+11:00",
      "end": "2025-10-12T12:00:00+11:00"
    }
  ]
  - Denormalized (duplicates gathering data) but self-contained
  - If organizer changes time_options, old responses still valid

  My recommendation: Option A for prototype
  - Simpler (just array of integers)
  - Normalizes data (single source of truth)
  - Trade-off: If organizer edits time_options, responses reference wrong slots

  ---
  Timezone Strategy

  You're right - timezone should be tied to gathering location, not user.

  Add to Gathering table:
  Gathering
  ├─ ...
  ├─ location: "Brunswick, VIC, Australia"
  ├─ timezone: "Australia/Melbourne"  // IANA timezone identifier
  └─ ...

  Why store timezone:
  - Google Places API can return timezone for location
  - All timestamps in gathering use this timezone
  - Display: "Sat 10am Melbourne time" (clear for remote participants)
  - Future: User in Sydney sees "11am Sydney time" (auto-convert)

  How to get timezone:
  1. User enters location: "Brunswick, VIC"
  2. Geocode with Google Places API → get coordinates
  3. Call Google Timezone API → get "Australia/Melbourne"
  4. Store on Gathering
  5. All time_options use this timezone

  ---
  Updated Schema Fields

  Gathering:

  {
    // ... other fields
    location: string,
    timezone: string,  // "Australia/Melbourne", "America/Los_Angeles"
    time_options: Array<{
      start: string,    // ISO 8601: "2025-10-11T10:00:00+11:00"
      end: string,      // ISO 8601: "2025-10-11T12:00:00+11:00"
      label?: string    // Optional: "Sat 11 Oct 10am-12pm" (for display)
    }>,
    rsvp_deadline: string,  // ISO 8601: "2025-10-10T18:00:00+11:00"
  }

  Response:

  {
    // ... other fields
    available_time_slot_indices: number[],  // [0, 1] = first and second options
    // OR
    available_time_slots: Array<{
      start: string,
      end: string
    }>
  }

  ---
  UI Flow (Enforces Structure)

  Organizer Creating Gathering:

  1. Enter location: "Brunswick, VIC"
     → Auto-detect timezone: "Australia/Melbourne" ✅

  2. Add time options:
     📅 Date picker: Select "Sat Oct 11, 2025"
     🕐 Time range: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM

     → Stores:
     {
       start: "2025-10-11T10:00:00+11:00",
       end: "2025-10-11T12:00:00+11:00"
     }

  3. Set RSVP deadline:
     📅 Oct 10, 2025
     🕐 6:00 PM

     → Stores: "2025-10-10T18:00:00+11:00"

  Invitee Responding:

  Shows: "Sarah's brunch (Melbourne time)"

  Time options (checkboxes):
  ☐ Sat Oct 11, 10am-12pm
  ☐ Sun Oct 12, 10am-12pm

  User checks both → Stores: [0, 1]

  ---
  Agent Benefits

  With proper timestamps:

  // Find availability overlap
  const responses = await getResponses(gathering_id)
  const timeOptions = gathering.time_options

  // Count votes per time slot
  const votes = timeOptions.map((option, index) => {
    const count = responses.filter(r =>
      r.available_time_slot_indices.includes(index)
    ).length

    return {
      slot: option,
      votes: count,
      percentage: count / responses.length
    }
  })

  // Best slot
  const best = votes.sort((a, b) => b.votes - a.votes)[0]

  // Agent output:
  "Sunday Oct 12, 10am-12pm works for 4/5 people (80%)"

  // Can also check: Is this in the past?
  const isPast = new Date(best.slot.start) < new Date()

  With venue search:
  // Check venue opening hours against chosen time
  const chosenTime = best.slot
  const venueOpeningHours = venue.opening_hours

  // Can do actual time comparisons!
  const venueOpensAt = parseTime(venue.hours.sunday.open)
  const gatheringStartsAt = new Date(chosenTime.start)

  if (gatheringStartsAt < venueOpensAt) {
    // Flag: "Venue opens at 11am but gathering is at 10am"
  }

  ---
  What You'd Miss With Strings

  - ✅ Validation: "Is deadline before first time option?" (catches organizer mistakes)
  - ✅ Past detection: "Can't create gathering in the past"
  - ✅ Sorting: "Show soonest gathering first"
  - ✅ Duration calc: "This is a 2-hour window"
  - ✅ Venue hours: "Restaurant opens at 11am, option is 10am" → conflict detection
  - ✅ Agent reliability: No string parsing failures

  ---
  Prototype Implementation

  Week 1 (Backend):
  // When creating gathering
  const timezone = await getTimezoneForLocation(location) // Google API
  gathering.timezone = timezone

  // Time options from UI
  gathering.time_options = [
    {
      start: new Date('2025-10-11T10:00:00+11:00').toISOString(),
      end: new Date('2025-10-11T12:00:00+11:00').toISOString()
    }
  ]

  Week 3 (Frontend):
  // Use browser's datetime-local input or React library
  <input
    type="datetime-local"
    onChange={(e) => setStartTime(new Date(e.target.value))}
  />

  // Or library like react-datepicker with timezone support
  <DatePicker
    selected={startTime}
    onChange={setStartTime}
    showTimeSelect
    timeZone={gathering.timezone}
  />

  You caught a critical flaw - timestamps are non-negotiable for production-quality data. Does this revised structure make sense?

> Thanks, that revised structure makes sense. I think the instinct to show human readable in the UI but store machine readable timestamp is right, and 
controlling human input via UI for validation rather than the scary flexibility of strings.  Should we review schema relationships between the 3 tables 
now and think carefully to see anything else is missing, oversimplified or overcomplicated? Or you're suggesting something else?

⏺ Perfect! Yes, let's do a comprehensive review. This is the critical "sanity check" phase - we'll look at the full picture to catch any issues before we
   code.

  Complete Schema Relationships Review

  Visual Overview

  User (Identity)
    ↓ organizer_id (1:Many)
  Gathering (Coordination Event)
    ↑ gathering_id (Many:1)
  Response (Participation + Preferences)
    ↑ user_id (Many:1)
  User

  ---
  1. Relationships & Cardinality

  User → Gathering (Organizer)

  - Type: One-to-Many
  - Foreign Key: Gathering.organizer_id → User.id
  - Meaning: One user can organize multiple gatherings
  - Questions:
    - ✅ Can gathering exist without organizer? No (organizer_id is required)
    - ✅ Can user organize 0 gatherings? Yes (they might only respond to others)
    - ✅ What if organizer deletes account? Prevent deletion OR transfer ownership

  Decision needed:
  -- Option A: Prevent deletion
  ON DELETE RESTRICT  // Can't delete user if they organized gatherings

  -- Option B: Cascade
  ON DELETE CASCADE   // Delete gatherings if organizer deleted (destructive!)

  -- Option C: Set null
  ON DELETE SET NULL  // gathering.organizer_id = null (orphaned gathering)

  My recommendation: RESTRICT for prototype
  - Safer (doesn't destroy data)
  - Forces explicit handling ("Transfer ownership before deleting")

  ---
  Gathering → Response (Has Many)

  - Type: One-to-Many
  - Foreign Key: Response.gathering_id → Gathering.id
  - Meaning: One gathering has multiple responses
  - Questions:
    - ✅ Can gathering exist with 0 responses? Yes (just created, waiting)
    - ✅ Can response exist without gathering? No (gathering_id is required)
    - ✅ What if gathering deleted? Cascade delete responses (responses are meaningless without gathering)

  Decision:
  ON DELETE CASCADE  // Delete all responses when gathering deleted

  ---
  User → Response (Submits)

  - Type: One-to-Many
  - Foreign Key: Response.user_id → User.id
  - Meaning: One user can submit multiple responses (across different gatherings)
  - Questions:
    - ✅ Can user exist with 0 responses? Yes (just created gathering, hasn't responded as participant)
    - ✅ Can response exist without user? No (user_id is required)
    - ✅ What if user deleted? Decision needed

  Options:
  -- Option A: Keep responses, anonymize user
  ON DELETE SET NULL
  // Response exists but user_id = null, show as "[Deleted User]"

  -- Option B: Delete responses
  ON DELETE CASCADE
  // Risky: Removes them from gathering coordination

  -- Option C: Prevent deletion
  ON DELETE RESTRICT
  // Can't delete if they've responded anywhere

  My recommendation: SET NULL for prototype
  - Keeps coordination data intact (agent still sees preferences)
  - Shows "[Deleted User]" in UI
  - Trade-off: Lose attribution but preserve group's data

  ---
  2. Constraints & Data Integrity

  Unique Constraints

  User.email - UNIQUE
  - ✅ Prevents duplicate accounts
  - ✅ Enables "find or create" pattern

  Response(gathering_id, user_id) - UNIQUE (Compound)
  - ✅ One response per user per gathering
  - ✅ Enables upsert (update existing or insert new)

  Missing anything?
  - Gathering.id - already unique (primary key)
  - User.id - already unique (primary key)

  ---
  Nullable Fields (What Can Be Empty?)

  User:
  - email - NOT NULL ✅ (required for identity)
  - name - NOT NULL ✅ (required for display)

  Gathering:
  - organizer_id - NOT NULL ✅ (must have owner)
  - title - NOT NULL ✅ (must have name)
  - location - NOT NULL ✅ (required for venue search)
  - timezone - NOT NULL ✅ (required for time interpretation)
  - time_options - NOT NULL ✅ (need at least one option)
  - rsvp_deadline - NOT NULL ✅ (when to trigger agent)
  - status - NOT NULL ✅ (always has state)
  - agent_output - NULLABLE ✅ (only after agent runs)

  Response:
  - gathering_id - NOT NULL ✅ (must belong to gathering)
  - user_id - NULLABLE ⚠️ (if user deleted, set null)
  - available_time_slot_indices - NOT NULL ✅ (must pick at least one? Question below)
  - budget_max - NULLABLE ✅ (flexible budget = null)
  - cuisine_preferences - NOT NULL ✅ (can be empty array [])
  - dietary_restrictions - NULLABLE ✅ (most people have none)
  - additional_notes - NULLABLE ✅ (optional)

  Question: Must user select at least one time slot?
  - If they can't attend any option → should they respond at all?
  - Option A: Require at least one (available_time_slot_indices.length > 0)
  - Option B: Allow empty array (means "I'm interested but can't do any of these times")

  My take: Option A for prototype (simpler logic). User who can't attend just doesn't respond.

  ---
  3. Missing Pieces?

  Let's think about workflows:

  Workflow: Organizer Cancels Gathering

  Current: Update Gathering.status = "cancelled"Missing:
  - ❌ Should we store cancellation reason?
  - ❌ Should we notify participants? (Out of scope for prototype)

  Add to Gathering?
  cancellation_reason: text, nullable

  My take: Not critical for prototype. Status="cancelled" is enough.

  ---
  Workflow: User Changes Response

  Current: Update existing Response (via unique constraint)Track history?
  - Do we care that Amy changed budget from $20 → $30?
  - For agent: No, only latest matters
  - For debugging: Maybe useful

  Missing:
  - No audit trail of changes

  Add ResponseHistory table?
  ResponseHistory
  ├─ id
  ├─ response_id
  ├─ field_changed
  ├─ old_value
  ├─ new_value
  └─ changed_at

  My take: Overkill for 4 weeks. Just track updated_at on Response.

  ---
  Workflow: Agent Runs Multiple Times

  Scenario:
  1. 3/5 people respond → Agent runs
  2. Person #4 responds → Agent should re-run?
  3. Person #5 responds → Re-run again?

  Current schema:
  - Gathering.agent_output gets overwritten each run
  - No history of previous recommendations

  Missing:
  - ❌ No audit trail of agent runs
  - ❌ Can't show "Agent re-analyzed after new responses"

  Add AgentRun table?
  AgentRun
  ├─ id
  ├─ gathering_id
  ├─ status: "running" | "completed" | "failed"
  ├─ input_snapshot (JSON: all responses at time of run)
  ├─ output (JSON: recommendations)
  ├─ error_message (nullable)
  ├─ started_at
  └─ completed_at

  Then Gathering points to latest:
  Gathering.latest_agent_run_id → AgentRun.id

  Pros:
  - ✅ Full audit trail
  - ✅ Can show "Agent ran 3 times, here's why recommendations changed"
  - ✅ Can resume failed runs

  Cons:
  - ❌ More complexity
  - ❌ Additional table/queries

  My recommendation for 4 weeks:
  - Skip AgentRun table (stick with agent_output on Gathering)
  - Simple rule: Agent only runs when status="collecting" and deadline/threshold met
  - Re-run: If organizer wants new recommendations, manually set status back to "collecting"

  Upgrade in v2 if agent reliability becomes issue.

  ---
  Workflow: Inviting People (Before They Respond)

  Current:
  - Organizer shares link
  - We don't know who's invited until they respond

  Missing:
  - ❌ Can't track "invited but not responded"
  - ❌ Can't show "Waiting on: Bob, Charlie"
  - ❌ Can't send reminders

  Add Invitation table?
  Invitation
  ├─ id
  ├─ gathering_id
  ├─ email (might not be in User table yet)
  ├─ status: "pending" | "responded" | "declined"
  └─ sent_at

  Pros:
  - ✅ Pre-populate invitees
  - ✅ Track who hasn't responded
  - ✅ Send reminder emails

  Cons:
  - ❌ More complexity (another table)
  - ❌ Need to sync with Response (invitation.status = "responded" when Response created)

  My recommendation for 4 weeks:
  - Skip Invitation table
  - Workaround: Organizer enters "Expected participants: 5" when creating
  - UI shows: "3/5 responded" (based on count, not specific names)

  Upgrade in v2 for better tracking.

  ---
  4. Overcomplicated?

  Is timezone on Gathering necessary?

  Without it:
  - Store all times in UTC: "2025-10-11T00:00:00Z"
  - Frontend converts to display timezone

  With it:
  - Store times in gathering's local timezone: "2025-10-11T10:00:00+11:00"
  - Clear which timezone applies

  My take: Keep it. Makes debugging easier ("Is 10am Melbourne time or UTC?")

  ---
  Is available_time_slot_indices too clever?

  Alternative: Just duplicate the timestamp data
  Response.availability: [
    { start: "2025-10-11T10:00:00+11:00", end: "..." },
    { start: "2025-10-12T10:00:00+11:00", end: "..." }
  ]

  Pros of indices: Normalized, smaller storagePros of duplication: Self-contained, works if organizer changes options

  My take: Indices are fine for prototype. Keep it simple.

  ---
  Is agent_output JSON too flexible?

  Risk: Frontend expects certain structure, agent returns different structure → crash

  Mitigation:
  - Define TypeScript interface for agent output
  - Validate structure before storing
  - Use LLM structured outputs (schema enforcement)

  My take: JSON is right choice. Just need good validation.

  ---
  5. Final Schema Checklist

  ✅ Have we covered:
  - Identity (User) ✅
  - Coordination context (Gathering) ✅
  - Multi-user input (Response) ✅
  - Relationships (foreign keys) ✅
  - Constraints (unique, nullable) ✅
  - Delete behavior (cascade, restrict, set null) ✅

  ❌ Intentionally deferred (v2 features):
  - Invitation tracking (who's invited but not responded)
  - Agent run history (audit trail)
  - Response change history
  - Notifications/reminders

  ⚠️ Edge cases to handle in code (not schema):
  - What if all users pick different time slots? (Agent escalates)
  - What if budget ranges don't overlap? (Agent escalates)
  - What if agent fails? (Set status="failed", show error)

  ---
  Summary: Are We Missing Anything Critical?

  For 4-week prototype, this schema covers:
  1. ✅ User identity & attribution
  2. ✅ Gathering lifecycle (create → collect → complete/cancel)
  3. ✅ Multi-user preferences for agent
  4. ✅ Agent output storage
  5. ✅ Data integrity (constraints, foreign keys)
  6. ✅ Proper timestamp handling

  Trade-offs we made:
  - No invitation tracking (can add later)
  - No agent run history (keep it simple)
  - No response change history (just latest)
  - Simplified delete behavior (restrict/cascade)

  Does this feel right? Any concerns or "what about..." scenarios?

> Your assessment seems sound to me for mvp and learning. Shall we move on to the schema file? Why did you go with Prisma? What does that mean and what 
are other types? 

⏺ Perfect question! Let me explain what Prisma is and why it's great for learning, then we'll create the schema file.

  ---
  What is Prisma? (And What Are the Alternatives?)

  The Problem: Talking to Databases

  When your application needs to store/retrieve data, you have several approaches:

  ---
  Option 1: Raw SQL

  What it is: Write SQL queries directly as strings

  // Insert a user
  const result = await db.query(`
    INSERT INTO users (id, email, name) 
    VALUES ('${userId}', '${email}', '${name}')
    RETURNING *
  `)

  // Get gatherings for a user
  const gatherings = await db.query(`
    SELECT g.*, u.name as organizer_name
    FROM gatherings g
    JOIN users u ON g.organizer_id = u.id
    WHERE g.organizer_id = '${userId}'
  `)

  Pros:
  - ✅ Full control (write any SQL you want)
  - ✅ Maximum performance (can optimize queries)

  Cons:
  - ❌ No type safety - gatherings[0].titel (typo) fails at runtime
  - ❌ SQL injection risk - User input in string interpolation
  - ❌ Manual schema management - You write CREATE TABLE statements by hand
  - ❌ Repetitive - Every query is from scratch
  - ❌ Database-specific - PostgreSQL SQL ≠ MySQL SQL

  Learning curve: High (need to know SQL well)

  Option 2: Query Builder (e.g., Knex.js)

  What it is: JavaScript functions that generate SQL

  // Insert a user
  const user = await db('users').insert({
    id: userId,
    email: email,
    name: name
  }).returning('*')

  // Get gatherings for a user
  const gatherings = await db('gatherings')
    .join('users', 'gatherings.organizer_id', 'users.id')
    .select('gatherings.*', 'users.name as organizer_name')
    .where('gatherings.organizer_id', userId)

  Pros:
  - ✅ Safer (auto-escapes values, prevents SQL injection)
  - ✅ Database-agnostic (mostly)
  - ✅ Composable (build queries programmatically)

  Cons:
  - ❌ Still no type safety - Typos fail at runtime
  - ❌ Still manual schema - Write migrations by hand
  - ❌ Need to know SQL concepts (joins, where clauses)

  Learning curve: Medium (easier than raw SQL, but still SQL-thinking)

  ---
  Option 3: ORM - Object Relational Mapper (e.g., Prisma, TypeORM, Sequelize)

  What it is: Map database tables to JavaScript/TypeScript objects

  Prisma approach:

  // Insert a user
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      email: email,
      name: name
    }
  })

  // Get gatherings for a user (with organizer details)
  const gatherings = await prisma.gathering.findMany({
    where: { organizerId: userId },
    include: { organizer: true }  // Auto-joins User table
  })

  // TypeScript knows the shape!
  gatherings[0].title  // ✅ Autocomplete works
  gatherings[0].titel  // ❌ TypeScript error before runtime

  Pros:
  - ✅ Type safety - TypeScript knows your database schema
  - ✅ Auto-completion - Editor suggests available fields
  - ✅ Schema-first - Define schema once, get DB + types + queries
  - ✅ Auto-migrations - Generates SQL migrations from schema changes
  - ✅ Relation handling - Joins happen automatically
  - ✅ Validation - Catches errors before hitting database

  Cons:
  - ❌ Less control (harder to write complex SQL)
  - ❌ Abstraction overhead (need to learn ORM's way)
  - ❌ Can generate inefficient queries (N+1 problem)

  Learning curve: Low to start, medium to master

  Why Prisma Specifically?

  There are many ORMs. Here's why Prisma for your learning journey:

  1. Schema-First Design (Perfect for Learning)

  Prisma:
  // schema.prisma - Single source of truth
  model User {
    id    String @id @default(uuid())
    email String @unique
    name  String

    organized_gatherings Gathering[]
    responses            Response[]
  }

  From this ONE file, Prisma generates:
  - SQL migrations (CREATE TABLE...)
  - TypeScript types (User interface)
  - Database client (prisma.user.create, .findMany, etc.)

  Other ORMs (e.g., TypeORM):
  // Define schema in TypeScript decorators
  @Entity()
  class User {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')
    id: string;

    @Column({ unique: true })
    email: string;

    @OneToMany(() => Gathering, gathering => gathering.organizer)
    organized_gatherings: Gathering[];
  }
  - More verbose
  - Schema = code (less declarative)

  Why Prisma wins: Schema file is clean, visual, easy to understand.

  ---
  2. Best-in-Class TypeScript Support

  Prisma:
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { email: "sarah@email.com" }
  })

  // TypeScript knows:
  user?.id       // string
  user?.email    // string
  user?.name     // string
  user?.title    // ❌ Error: Property 'title' doesn't exist

  Other ORMs: Type safety varies. Some require manual type definitions.

  ---
  3. Migrations Are Beginner-Friendly

  Prisma:
  # You edit schema.prisma (change a field)
  # Then run:
  npx prisma migrate dev --name add_timezone_to_gathering

  # Prisma:
  # 1. Generates SQL migration automatically
  # 2. Applies it to database
  # 3. Updates TypeScript types

  Other approaches: Write SQL migration by hand (error-prone).

  ---
  4. Prisma Studio (Visual Database Browser)

  npx prisma studio
  Opens GUI in browser:
  - See all your tables
  - Browse data
  - Edit records manually
  - Great for debugging

  Alternatives: Need separate tools (pgAdmin, TablePlus).

  ---
  5. Clear Error Messages

  Prisma:
  Invalid `prisma.user.create()` invocation:

    {
      data: {
        email: "sarah@email.com",
  +     name: String
        // ^^^^ Missing required field
      }
    }

  Raw SQL: Generic error: "column 'name' has no default value" (harder to trace).

  Why Prisma for 4-Week Timeline

  Week 1 benefits:
  - Define schema in 1 file (what we just designed)
  - Auto-generate database tables (no manual SQL)
  - Get TypeScript types for free (catch errors early)

  Week 2 benefits:
  - Write queries fast: prisma.gathering.findUnique({ where: { id } })
  - No SQL knowledge needed initially
  - Autocomplete guides you

  Week 3-4 benefits:
  - Change schema → re-run migration → types update automatically
  - Prisma Studio to inspect data visually
  - Easy to understand when debugging

  Learning value:
  - Understand relational concepts (foreign keys, joins) through Prisma's clean syntax
  - TypeScript teaches you what's possible (can't query non-existent fields)
  - Can always drop down to raw SQL later if needed

  ---
  The Trade-Off

  Prisma hides SQL from you - is this bad for learning?

  My take: No, because:
  1. You designed the schema (understand the structure)
  2. Prisma's syntax maps clearly to SQL concepts
  3. You can see generated SQL with logging: prisma.$queryRaw
  4. Better to learn app logic first, SQL optimization later

  Think of it like: Learn to drive automatic before manual transmission.

  ---
  Ready to Create the Schema File?

  Now that you understand WHY Prisma, let's write the actual schema.prisma file based on our design.

  This file will:
  - Define all 3 tables (User, Gathering, Response)
  - Set up relationships (foreign keys)
  - Configure constraints (unique, nullable)
  - Specify delete behaviors (cascade, restrict, set null)

  Sound good?

> thanks for the detailed explanation. let's go ahead with the prisma file. I particularly like the debugging benefits 

⏺ Write(schema.prisma)
  ⎿  Wrote 84 lines to schema.prisma                         
     // Amica - Meetup Coordination Agent
     // Database schema for multi-user async state management
     generator client {
       provider = "prisma-client-js"
     }
     datasource db {
       provider = "postgresql"
       url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
     … +74 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Schema file created at /Users/nhungnguyen/Documents/agent/amica/schema.prisma

  Let me walk you through the Prisma-specific syntax so you understand what each part means:

  ---
  Prisma Schema Syntax Breakdown

  1. Configuration Blocks (Top of File)

  generator client {
    provider = "prisma-client-js"
  }
  What: Tells Prisma to generate a JavaScript/TypeScript clientWhy: This creates the prisma.user.create() API you'll use in codeWhen it runs: Every time
  you run npx prisma generate

  datasource db {
    provider = "postgresql"
    url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  }
  What: Database connection configprovider: Which database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)url: Connection string from environment variable (keeps
  secrets out of code)Example .env file:
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/amica"

  ---
  2. Model Definitions (Tables)

  model User {
    // fields here
  }
  What: Defines a database tableResult: Creates users table (see @@map("users") at bottom)Generates: TypeScript type User + query methods prisma.user.*

  ---
  3. Field Types & Attributes

  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  Breakdown:
  - id - Field name (becomes column name)
  - String - Data type (TEXT in PostgreSQL)
  - @id - Attribute: This is the primary key
  - @default(uuid()) - Attribute: Auto-generate UUID when creating record

  Common types:
  - String → TEXT / VARCHAR
  - Int → INTEGER
  - DateTime → TIMESTAMP
  - Json → JSONB (PostgreSQL)
  - Boolean → BOOLEAN

  email     String   @unique
  @unique - Creates unique constraint (no duplicate emails)

  agentOutput  Json?   @map("agent_output")
  ? - Nullable (can be null)@map("agent_output") - Database column is snake_case, Prisma field is camelCaseWhy: Follow PostgreSQL convention (snake_case)
   but use JavaScript convention (camelCase) in code

  createdAt DateTime @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt @map("updated_at")
  @default(now()) - Set to current timestamp on creation@updatedAt - Auto-update to current timestamp on every modification

  ---
  4. Relationships (Foreign Keys)

  model Gathering {
    organizerId  String  @map("organizer_id")
    
    // Relationship definition
    organizer User @relation("OrganizerRelation", fields: [organizerId], references: [id], onDelete: Restrict)
  }

  Breakdown:
  - organizer - Relation field name (not a database column, just for Prisma)
  - User - Type of related model
  - @relation("OrganizerRelation") - Name (needed when multiple relations to same model)
  - fields: [organizerId] - Foreign key column in THIS table
  - references: [id] - Points to id in User table
  - onDelete: Restrict - Can't delete User if they organized Gatherings

  The reverse side (User model):
  model User {
    organizedGatherings Gathering[] @relation("OrganizerRelation")
  }
  - Gathering[] - Array type (one user has many gatherings)
  - Must match the relation name

  Delete behaviors we used:
  - Restrict - Prevent deletion (User can't be deleted if they organized gatherings)
  - Cascade - Delete related records (Delete gathering → delete all responses)
  - SetNull - Set foreign key to null (Delete user → response.userId becomes null)

  ---
  5. Enums (Limited Set of Values)

  enum GatheringStatus {
    COLLECTING
    COMPLETED
    FAILED
    CANCELLED
  }

  model Gathering {
    status GatheringStatus @default(COLLECTING)
  }

  What: Creates PostgreSQL ENUM typeWhy: Database enforces only these 4 values allowedDefault: New gatherings start as COLLECTINGIn code: TypeScript
  knows exact values: status: "COLLECTING" | "COMPLETED" | "FAILED" | "CANCELLED"

  ---
  6. Compound Constraints

  model Response {
    gatheringId String
    userId      String?

    @@unique([gatheringId, userId], name: "one_response_per_user_per_gathering")
  }

  @@unique([...]) - Block-level attribute (applies to model, not single field)What: Creates composite unique constraint on BOTH fields togetherResult:
  Can't have two responses with same (gatheringId, userId) pairname: Optional, helps identify constraint in error messages

  ---
  7. Table Naming

  model User {
    // fields...

    @@map("users")
  }

  @@map("users") - Map model name to database table nameWithout it: Table would be called "User" (capitalized)With it: Table is called "users"
  (PostgreSQL convention: lowercase, plural)

  Field mapping:
  organizerId String @map("organizer_id")
  JavaScript: gathering.organizerIdDatabase: gatherings.organizer_id

  ---
  How This Schema Creates Your Database

  When you run migrations:

  npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_schema

  Prisma generates SQL like:

  CREATE TABLE users (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
  );

  CREATE TYPE "GatheringStatus" AS ENUM ('COLLECTING', 'COMPLETED', 'FAILED', 'CANCELLED');

  CREATE TABLE gatherings (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    organizer_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    location TEXT NOT NULL,
    timezone TEXT NOT NULL,
    time_options JSONB NOT NULL,
    rsvp_deadline TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    status "GatheringStatus" DEFAULT 'COLLECTING',
    agent_output JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,

    FOREIGN KEY (organizer_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT
  );

  CREATE TABLE responses (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    gathering_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id TEXT,
    available_time_slot_indices INTEGER[] NOT NULL,
    budget_max INTEGER,
    cuisine_preferences JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
    dietary_restrictions TEXT,
    additional_notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,

    FOREIGN KEY (gathering_id) REFERENCES gatherings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,

    UNIQUE (gathering_id, user_id)
  );

  You never write this SQL - Prisma does it for you!

  ---
  Debugging Benefits You'll Love

  1. Prisma Studio (Visual Debugger)

  npx prisma studio
  Opens browser GUI:
  - Click "users" → see all users
  - Edit record inline
  - See relationships (click user → see their gatherings)

  2. Query Logging

  // See exact SQL Prisma generates
  const prisma = new PrismaClient({
    log: ['query', 'info', 'warn', 'error'],
  })

  // When you run:
  await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { email: "sarah@email.com" }})

  // Console shows:
  // prisma:query SELECT id, email, name FROM users WHERE email = 'sarah@email.com'

  3. Type-Safe Errors

  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      email: "sarah@email.com"
      // Missing 'name' field
    }
  })

  // TypeScript error BEFORE running:
  // Property 'name' is missing in type '{ email: string }' 
  // but required in type 'UserCreateInput'

  4. Relation Debugging

  // Load gathering with all responses AND user details
  const gathering = await prisma.gathering.findUnique({
    where: { id: gatheringId },
    include: {
      responses: {
        include: {
          user: true  // Includes user details for each response
        }
      },
      organizer: true
    }
  })

  // Console.log and see full nested structure clearly

  Next Steps

  Now that we have the schema file:

  1. Set up PostgreSQL (database server)
  2. Install Prisma CLI (npm install prisma --save-dev)
  3. Run first migration (creates tables)
  4. Generate Prisma Client (creates the query API)

  Then you can start writing queries like:
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: { email: "sarah@email.com", name: "Sarah" }
  })

  Want to understand the setup process next, or do you have questions about the schema syntax?

> I might need to take a break from this. Is this the right time to pause or I should do it after the setup? Also can I resume the conversation next with
 you or should I just leave this window open and resume later? 

⏺ Perfect time to pause! We just completed a major milestone - the schema design. This is a natural break point.

  ---
  What You've Accomplished

  ✅ Complete schema design (User, Gathering, Response)✅ Thought through relationships, constraints, and edge cases✅ Created schema.prisma file✅
  Understood async multi-user state management patterns✅ Learned database design principles (foreign keys, join tables, normalization)

  This is solid foundation work. The schema is the hardest design decision - everything else builds on this.

  ---
  Resuming Your Session

  You can start a fresh conversation - you don't need to keep this window open.

  When you return, just say:
  "I'm back to continue building Amica. We finished the schema design (schema.prisma file exists). Ready for the next phase."

  I'll pick up where we left off. The schema file is saved in your project, so no work is lost.

  ---
  What's Next (When You Resume)

  Phase 2: Database Setup (~30 min)
  1. Install PostgreSQL
  2. Install Prisma CLI
  3. Run first migration (creates actual database tables)
  4. Explore data in Prisma Studio

  Then: Start building the API (Week 1 continues)

  ---
  Optional: Quick Review Before Next Session

  When you come back, quickly re-read schema.prisma to refresh:
  - What each table represents
  - How they relate to each other
  - Why we made certain decisions (timestamps vs strings, JSON fields, etc.)

  This will make the setup phase smoother.

  ---
  Take your break - you've done great work on the design phase! 🎯

> last question before I go, should I commit the changes with the prisma file or wait til later? 

⏺ Commit now! This is a perfect checkpoint - complete, self-contained work.

  Let me walk you through your first git commit (takes 2 minutes):

  ---
  Your First Git Commit

⏺ Bash(git status)
  ⎿  On branch main                                                  
     Untracked files:
       (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
     … +4 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! See the schema.prisma file? Let's save it:

⏺ Bash(git add schema.prisma)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git status)
  ⎿  On branch main                                     
     Changes to be committed:
       (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
     … +5 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Good! File is staged (ready to commit). Now save it with a message:

⏺ Bash(git commit -m "Design database schema for multi-user coordination…)
  ⎿  [main 0c3aaab] Design database schema for multi-user coordination
      1 file changed, 83 insertions(+)
      create mode 100644 schema.prisma

⏺ Done! ✅ Your first commit is saved.

  ---
  What Just Happened

  1. git status - Showed what changed (schema.prisma was new)
  2. git add schema.prisma - Staged the file (marked it for saving)
  3. git commit -m "..." - Created a checkpoint with a message

  Result: You can now:
  - Revert to this point anytime if things break later
  - See what changed since this checkpoint
  - Share your work (later, with git push)

  Your commit message explained "why" (multi-user coordination) not just "what" (added schema) - this is best practice.

  ---
  Verify Your Commit

⏺ Bash(git log --oneline -n 3)
  ⎿  0c3aaab Design database schema for multi-user coordination
     603f3eb Initial amica project structure

⏺ Perfect! See your checkpoint saved:
  - 0c3aaab - Your new commit (schema design)
  - 603f3eb - Initial project setup

  ---
  Now you can safely take your break. Your work is saved in git history. When you return, just start a fresh conversation and we'll continue with
  database setup.

  Enjoy your break! 🎉
