> I want to build Amica, a sophisticated meetup coordination agent with async multi-user state management.

Context:
- Full PRD is in docs/PRD.md
- UI mockups are in design/mockups/ 
- Previous CrewAI agent work is in reference/crewai-baseline/

Learning objectives:
- Understand full-stack development with mentoring approach
- Learn async state management for multi-user coordination
- Learn git fundamentals as we build
- Explain architectural decisions - I learn best understanding "why" not just "how"

Think hard about the optimal development sequence starting with schema design for async multi-user state 
management. Create a detailed development plan that breaks this into learning-focused phases. 

⏺ I'll help you build Amica with a mentoring approach focused on understanding architectural decisions.
  Let me first explore the PRD, mockups, and existing code to create a comprehensive development plan.

⏺ Analysis Complete! Here's the Learning-Focused Development Plan

  Why Start with Schema Design?

  The schema is your app's contract with reality. In a multi-user async app, you have a critical
  challenge: multiple people's actions happening at different times need to coordinate toward a shared 
  goal. Your schema defines:

  1. What state needs to persist (between user sessions)
  2. Who owns what (permissions/isolation)
  3. How changes propagate (one person's RSVP affects everyone's view)
  4. When the agent acts (triggers based on state transitions)

  Think of it like designing a shared whiteboard before people start writing on it. If you don't plan the
  structure, you get chaos.

  ---
  Phase 1: Schema Design & Database Foundation (Learning: Data modeling, async state)

  Core Entities & Why They Matter:

  User
  ├─ id, email, name, auth_provider
  └─ WHY: Identity anchor. Every action needs attribution.

  Gathering 
  ├─ id, organizer_id, title, location, time_options[], rsvp_deadline
  ├─ status: "collecting_rsvps" | "analyzing" | "recommended" | "confirmed"
  └─ WHY: The coordination context. Status drives agent triggers.

  GatheringParticipant (join table)
  ├─ gathering_id, user_id, status: "invited" | "responded" | "declined"
  ├─ availability[], budget, cuisine_prefs[], dietary_restrictions[]
  └─ WHY: Multi-user state lives here. One person's response doesn't 
          overwrite another's. Agent needs ALL responses to analyze.

  AgentRun
  ├─ id, gathering_id, agent_type, status, input, output, created_at
  └─ WHY: Audit trail + Resume capability. If agent fails, you can retry
          without losing context. Shows users "what the AI is doing."

  VenueRecommendation
  ├─ id, agent_run_id, gathering_id, venue_data{}, match_score, reasoning
  └─ WHY: Separates agent output from gathering state. Multiple runs can
          create different recommendations without clobbering each other.

  Key Design Decision: Why Separate AgentRun from Gathering?

  Option A (Bad): Store agent output directly on GatheringProblem: One agent run overwrites previous. No
  history. Can't show "why did the agent pick this?"

  Option B (Good): Separate AgentRun tableBenefits:
  - History of all agent attempts (great for debugging)
  - Can show users "The agent ran 3 times, here's why it changed recommendations"
  - Easy retry logic if agent fails
  - Clear audit trail for learning/debugging

  This is async state management 101: Separate events (AgentRun) from current state (Gathering).

  ---
  Phase 2: Git Fundamentals (Learning: Version control as we build)

  We'll learn git just-in-time as we need it:

  Week 1-2 concepts:
  - git status: "What changed?" (after every coding session)
  - git add: "Mark this for saving" (stage files)
  - git commit: "Save a checkpoint with a message" (commit with why, not what)
  - Why: Checkpoints let you experiment safely. Break something? Rewind to last commit.

  Week 3-4 concepts:
  - git branch: "Create a parallel universe to try risky changes"
  - git checkout: "Switch between universes"
  - git merge: "Bring changes from experiment back to main"
  - Why: Keeps stable code separate from experiments. Crucial for learning.

  Later:
  - git log: History of your decisions
  - git diff: "What exactly changed between two points?"

  We'll create commits together after each feature, discussing what message captures the "why."

  ---
  Phase 3: Backend Architecture (Learning: APIs, async jobs, event-driven design)

  Technology Stack (and Why):

  Node.js + TypeScript
  - Why: Type safety helps beginners catch errors before runtime. TS makes the codebase self-documenting.

  PostgreSQL
  - Why: Relational database perfect for multi-user coordination. Transactions prevent race conditions
  (two people RSVPing at same time).

  Prisma ORM
  - Why: Schema-first design. You define schema, Prisma generates type-safe database client. Less SQL to
  write initially.

  tRPC or REST API
  - Why: Type-safe API between frontend/backend. Great for learning because editor shows you what's
  available.

  BullMQ (job queue)
  - Why: Agent runs take time (10-30 seconds). Can't block user's browser. Queue lets you "start job →
  show loading → notify when done."

  API Design (Event-Driven):

  POST /gatherings/create
  → Creates gathering, sends invites (async email job)

  POST /gatherings/:id/rsvp
  → User submits preferences
  → Check: "Is this the last person or past deadline?"
  → If yes: Trigger agent workflow (async job)

  GET /gatherings/:id/status
  → Real-time status: "2/5 responded" or "Agent analyzing..." or "Here are recommendations"

  POST /agent-runs/:id/approve
  → Organizer approves venue → Booking flow (future phase)

  Why event-driven? User actions trigger state changes trigger agent actions. This mirrors real-world
  async coordination.

  ---
  Phase 4: Frontend (React/Next.js) (Learning: State management, optimistic updates)

  Why Next.js:

  - Server components: Some data fetching happens server-side (faster initial load)
  - Built-in routing: File system = routes (less config for beginners)
  - API routes: Can start with backend in same project, split later

  State Management Approach:

  React Query (TanStack Query)
  - Why: Perfect for async server state. Auto-refetches when data changes. Shows loading/error states
  automatically.

  Optimistic Updates Example:
  User clicks "Submit RSVP"
  → Immediately show "✓ Your response is recorded" (optimistic)
  → Send to server in background
  → If fails, revert + show error

  Why: Makes app feel instant even with network delay. Critical for good UX.

  Key Learning: Server State vs Client State

  Server state: Who has RSVP'd, agent recommendations
  - Lives in database, multiple users share it
  - Use React Query to fetch/cache

  Client state: "Is this dropdown open?", form inputs before submit
  - Only this user's browser cares
  - Use React hooks (useState)

  Mixing these is the #1 beginner mistake.

  ---
  Phase 5: Agent Integration (Learning: LLM orchestration, error handling)

  Migrating from CrewAI to Production:

  CrewAI Baseline Limitations:
  - Synchronous (blocks while running)
  - No database persistence
  - No error recovery
  - Single-user simulation

  Production Agent Architecture:

  Job Queue (BullMQ)
    ↓
  Agent Orchestrator
    ├─ Step 1: Analyze preferences (LLM call)
    │   Save to AgentRun table → Status "analyzing_preferences"
    │
    ├─ Step 2: Search venues (Google Places API)
    │   Save results → Status "searching_venues"
    │
    ├─ Step 3: Match & rank (LLM call with venues + preferences)
    │   Save to VenueRecommendation → Status "completed"
    │
    └─ If error at any step: Status "failed", save error message
        User sees: "Agent encountered an issue, please review preferences"

  Why this structure:
  - Each step saves state → Can resume if server crashes
  - User sees progress: "Agent is analyzing preferences..."
  - Failed runs don't lose data (stored in AgentRun)
  - Easy to add human-in-loop ("Agent needs your input on X")

  LLM Call Design:

  Structured outputs (not raw text):
  const preferencesAnalysis = await llm.generate({
    prompt: buildPreferencesPrompt(allRSVPs),
    schema: z.object({
      availabilityConsensus: z.string(),
      budgetRange: z.object({ min: z.number(), max: z.number() }),
      cuisinePreferences: z.array(z.string()),
      conflicts: z.array(z.string())
    })
  })

  Why schemas: Ensures agent output is parseable. Can't get "Agent returned gibberish and crashed."

  ---
  Phase 6: Real-Time Features (Learning: WebSockets, subscriptions)

  When person #3 RSVPs, person #1 (the organizer) should see "3/5 responded" without refreshing.

  Options:

  Short polling (beginner-friendly):
  Every 5 seconds: GET /gatherings/:id/status
  Update UI if changed
  Why start here: Simple, easy to debug, works for v1.

  WebSockets (later):
  Server pushes updates when state changes
  Browser receives "gathering_updated" event → UI updates
  Why later: More complex, but better UX. Learn after mastering basics.

  Next Steps: Your Decision

  Before we write any code, I want to make sure you're comfortable with this plan. Here's what I
  recommend:

  Option A (Schema-First): Start by designing the database schema together. I'll explain each table/field,
   you ask questions until it makes sense. Then we implement it.

  Option B (Prototype-First): Build a simple "hello world" API + React app first to understand the stack,
  then tackle schema design.

  Option C (Explore Baseline): Dig into the CrewAI code together, run it, understand what it does, then
  plan how to evolve it.

  Which resonates with you? Or do you have questions about any part of this plan?

> This plan is too expansive for my timeline. I have 4 weeks maximum to build a working prototype to learn
 core concepts, it doesn't need to be production grade and polish. Can you revise the plan? I agree on 
starting with schema first. 

⏺ Revised 4-Week Prototype Plan

  You're right - let's cut to the essentials. Here's what you'll learn with a working prototype:

  ---
  Core Learning Goals (4 weeks)

  1. Schema design for multi-user async state
  2. API fundamentals (CRUD operations)
  3. Agent integration (async workflow)
  4. Basic frontend (forms + displaying data)
  5. Git basics (commit, branch, merge)

  ---
  Simplified Stack (Fewer Moving Parts)

  Backend:
  - Node.js + Express (simpler than tRPC for learning)
  - PostgreSQL + Prisma (same - good foundation)
  - No auth: Just email input (no passwords, no OAuth)
  - No job queue: Agent runs synchronously (user waits 30 seconds - fine for prototype)

  Frontend:
  - React (Vite) - Not Next.js (one less concept)
  - Basic fetch calls - No React Query yet
  - Minimal CSS - Function over form

  What We're Cutting:
  - ❌ Authentication/authorization
  - ❌ Email notifications (just show link to copy)
  - ❌ Real-time updates (refresh page to see changes)
  - ❌ Deployment (runs on localhost)
  - ❌ Error recovery/retry logic
  - ❌ UI polish

  ---
  Minimal Schema (3 Core Tables)

  User
  ├─ id (uuid)
  ├─ email
  └─ name

  Gathering
  ├─ id (uuid)
  ├─ organizer_id → User
  ├─ title (e.g., "Brunch in Melbourne")
  ├─ location
  ├─ time_options (json: ["Sat 11 Oct", "Sun 12 Oct"])
  ├─ rsvp_deadline (datetime)
  ├─ status ("collecting" | "completed")
  └─ agent_output (json, nullable) - stores final recommendation

  Response (instead of GatheringParticipant)
  ├─ id
  ├─ gathering_id → Gathering
  ├─ user_id → User
  ├─ availability (json: ["Sat 11 Oct"])
  ├─ budget_max (number)
  ├─ cuisine_prefs (json: ["Italian", "Japanese"])
  └─ dietary_restrictions (text)

  Why simpler:
  - No separate AgentRun table (store output on Gathering for now)
  - No VenueRecommendation table (embed in agent_output)
  - Status is binary (collecting vs done) - no intermediate states

  Trade-off: Less audit trail, but 80% of learning value with 30% of complexity.

  Week 1: Schema + API Foundation

  Days 1-2: Database Setup
  - Install PostgreSQL, Prisma
  - Design schema together (I explain each field, you ask why)
  - Write migration
  - Seed with dummy data
  - Git: init, first commit

  Days 3-5: Core API
  POST /gatherings/create
    → Creates gathering, returns ID + shareable link

  GET /gatherings/:id
    → Returns gathering details + all responses

  POST /gatherings/:id/respond
    → User submits their preferences
    → Check if all responses in → trigger agent

  GET /gatherings/:id/recommendations
    → Returns agent output (if status = "completed")

  Learning: REST APIs, database queries, JSON handlingGit: Branch per feature, merge to main

  ---
  Week 2: Agent Integration

  Days 1-3: Migrate CrewAI Logic
  - Extract preference analysis logic
  - Extract venue search logic
  - Make it work with your PostgreSQL data (not hardcoded)
  - Call OpenAI API with structured prompts
  - Call Google Places API

  Days 4-5: Wire Agent to API
  - When last person responds → run agent workflow
  - Store results in gathering.agent_output
  - Handle errors gracefully (return error message if agent fails)

  Learning: Async/await, API integration, error handlingGit: Agent work in separate branch, merge when
  working

  ---
  Week 3: Frontend Basics

  Days 1-2: Gathering Creation Flow
  Form: Title, Location, Time Options, RSVP Deadline
  Submit → POST /gatherings/create
  Show: "Share this link: localhost:3000/g/abc123"

  Days 3-5: Response Flow + Results
  /g/:id → Shows gathering details
  Form: Availability, Budget, Cuisine, Dietary needs
  Submit → POST /gatherings/:id/respond
  Show: "Thanks! 2/5 people have responded"

  If status=completed → Show recommendations

  Learning: React components, forms, state, routingGit: Frontend work in frontend branch

  ---
  Week 4: Integration + Testing

  Days 1-2: Connect Everything
  - Frontend calls backend APIs
  - Test full flow: Create → Share → 3 people respond → Agent runs → See results
  - Fix bugs

  Days 3-4: Handle Edge Cases
  - What if agent fails? Show error message
  - What if someone changes response? (Update, re-run agent)
  - What if 0 people respond? (Don't run agent)

  Day 5: Demo Prep
  - Seed realistic data
  - Test with friends (share link, have them RSVP)
  - Document what you learned

  Learning: Integration, debugging, manual testingGit: Merge all branches, tag v1.0

  ---
  What You'll Have After 4 Weeks

  ✅ Working prototype: Create gathering → Friends respond → Agent recommends venues✅ Understanding of
  multi-user state management✅ Experience with full-stack development✅ Git fundamentals (commit, branch,
   merge)✅ Agent integration (LLM + external APIs)✅ Foundation to add polish later (auth, real-time,
  deployment)

  ---
  What's NOT Included (Add Later If You Want)

  - Authentication (anyone can access any gathering via link)
  - Email notifications (manually share links)
  - Real-time updates (refresh to see changes)
  - UI polish (basic HTML forms, minimal CSS)
  - Deployment (runs on localhost only)
  - Error recovery (if agent fails, manually retry)

  ---
  Let's Start: Schema Design Session

  I'll walk you through designing each table. For each field, I'll explain:
  - What it stores
  - Why we need it
  - How it's used in the app

  Then you ask questions until it clicks. Sound good?

  We'll start with the User table - the simplest one. Ready?

> I still think that authentication is still critical  for the app. Can we use email only indentification 
for the first 3 weeks  and add oAuth later? Also what would I understand more from agentic work 
perspective? 

⏺ Great Points! Let me revise:

  ---
  Email Authentication (Simple & Secure Enough)

  Week 1 approach:
  When user creates gathering or responds:
  → Enter email + name
  → Store in User table (or find existing)
  → Save user_id in browser cookie/localStorage
  → That's it - no password, no verification yet

  Why this works:
  - ✅ User attribution (who created what, who responded)
  - ✅ Prevents accidental overwrites (each response tied to user)
  - ✅ Realistic (tracks who's who)
  - ✅ Easy upgrade path (add password/OAuth in week 4 if time)

  Week 4 upgrade (optional):
  - Magic link via email: Click link → auto-login
  - Or simple OAuth with Google/Apple

  Trade-off: Someone could put fake email initially, but for prototype testing with friends it's fine.

  ---
  What You'll Learn: Agent Work Perspective

  This is the core learning value - let me break down what's different from typical API integration:

  1. Multi-Agent Orchestration (Not Just "Call OpenAI")

  Traditional API:                Agent Workflow:
  User asks question         →    State change triggers workflow
  Call LLM once              →    Step 1: Preference Agent analyzes
  Return answer              →    Step 2: Venue Agent searches
                             →    Step 3: Ranking Agent matches
                             →    Each step uses previous output

  Learning: How to chain agents where each agent has a specific role and output of one feeds the next.

  ---
  2. Structured Outputs (Reliability)

  Problem: LLMs return text. Your app needs data structures.

  What you'll learn:
  // Bad: Pray the LLM returns valid JSON
  const result = await llm.generate("Analyze these preferences...")
  const parsed = JSON.parse(result) // Might crash!

  // Good: Enforce structure with schema
  const result = await llm.generate({
    prompt: "Analyze preferences...",
    response_format: {
      budget_range: { min: number, max: number },
      consensus_cuisines: string[],
      availability_overlap: string,
      conflicts: string[]
    }
  })
  // Guaranteed to match schema or retry

  Why critical: Agents in production can't return gibberish. You'll learn how to make LLM outputs
  parseable and predictable.

  ---
  3. Tool Use / Function Calling

  Traditional: You manually call Google Places APIAgent approach: LLM decides when to call it and with
  what parameters

  Preference Agent outputs:
  → "Group wants Italian or Japanese, budget $20-30, Sunday 10am-12pm"

  Venue Agent receives this + has access to tool:
  → LLM decides: "I should search for 'Italian restaurants' near
     'Melbourne' with price_level=2"
  → Calls Google Places API with those params
  → Receives venues
  → Ranks them based on preference match

  Learning: How to give agents tools and let them decide when/how to use them. This is core to modern
  agent frameworks.

  ---
  4. Context Management (Memory)

  Challenge: Agent needs to "remember" all RSVPs to make good decisions.

  You'll build:
  - Short-term memory: Current gathering's responses
  - Long-term memory (future): User always prefers vegetarian

  What you'll learn:
  // Building agent context
  const agentContext = {
    gathering: gathering,
    responses: allResponses, // All RSVPs
    venue_data: googlePlacesResults,
    constraints: {
      must_accommodate_all: true,
      budget_max: maxBudgetFromResponses
    }
  }

  // Agent uses this to make informed decisions

  ---
  5. State-Based Triggers (When Does Agent Act?)

  Not: User clicks "run agent"But: System detects conditions → auto-triggers agent

  You'll implement:

  When response submitted:
    ↓
  Check: response_count === invitee_count
    OR current_time > rsvp_deadline?
    ↓
  If YES → Trigger preference analysis agent
    ↓
  Preference agent completes
    ↓
  Auto-trigger venue search agent
    ↓
  Venue agent completes
    ↓
  Update gathering.status = "completed"

  Learning: Event-driven agent orchestration - agents react to state changes, not manual triggers.

  ---
  6. Human-in-the-Loop (Escalation)

  Scenario: Agent finds no venues matching all criteria.

  What you'll build:
  Agent detects conflict:
  → "Budget range is $20-30 but all 3 people want different cuisines
     with no overlap. Unable to find consensus."

  → Update gathering.status = "needs_review"
  → Show organizer: "We need your help resolving conflicts"
  → Organizer manually picks compromise
  → Agent re-runs with override

  Learning: When to let agents decide vs escalate to humans. This is crucial for real-world agent systems.

  ---
  7. Iterative Refinement (Self-Correction)

  Advanced concept you can add in Week 4:

  Venue Agent completes:
    ↓
  Ranking Agent evaluates output:
    "Do these 3 venues actually match the criteria?"
    ↓
  If confidence < 80% → Flag for organizer review
  If confidence > 80% → Auto-approve

  Learning: Agents checking other agents' work - multi-agent collaboration pattern.

  ---
  Concrete Agent Learning Outcomes

  By Week 4, you'll understand:

  ✅ Orchestration: How to chain multiple agent steps✅ Structured outputs: How to make LLM responses
  reliable✅ Tool calling: How agents use external APIs based on decisions✅ Context building: What
  information agents need to make good choices✅ Triggers: When to run agents automatically vs manual✅
  Error handling: What to do when agents fail or disagree✅ Human oversight: When to escalate vs let agent
   decide✅ State management: How agent outputs change app state

  This is different from "I called an LLM API" - you're building a multi-agent coordination system.

  Revised 4-Week Plan with Email Auth

  Does this timeline + agent learning focus make sense? Ready to start with schema design?

> Excellent. Let's dive into the schema design. 

⏺ Perfect! Let's start with the foundation. We'll design each table together, and I'll explain the
  reasoning behind every decision.

  ---
  Table 1: User

  This is your identity table - every person who interacts with Amica gets a record here.

  User
  ├─ id               (UUID, primary key)
  ├─ email            (string, unique)
  ├─ name             (string)
  ├─ created_at       (timestamp)
  └─ updated_at       (timestamp)

  Field-by-Field Breakdown:

  id - UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
  - What: A unique string like "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  - Why UUID vs auto-incrementing number?
    - Security: Can't guess other user IDs (with numbers: if you're user 100, user 101 exists)
    - Distributed systems: If you later split database, UUIDs don't collide
    - Shareable links: /g/550e8400... is less guessable than /g/1
  - Trade-off: Slightly larger storage, but worth it for security

  email - String, unique
  - What: User's email address
  - Why unique constraint?
    - Prevents duplicate accounts ("sarah@email.com" can only exist once)
    - Email becomes the natural identifier humans use
    - Enables "find existing user by email" when they RSVP to multiple gatherings
  - How it's used:
    - When creating gathering: Check if organizer email exists → use existing User or create new
    - When responding: Same check → ties all responses to same User

  name - String
  - What: Display name (e.g., "Sarah Chen")
  - Why separate from email?
    - Email is for identity (technical)
    - Name is for display (human-friendly)
    - Shows "Sarah responded" instead of "sarah.chen@gmail.com responded"
  - Could we derive this from email?
    - No - "sarah.chen@gmail.com" → is name "Sarah" or "Sarah Chen"? Better to ask.

  created_at / updated_at - Timestamps
  - What: When user was first created / last modified
  - Why?
    - Debugging ("When did this user first show up?")
    - Future features: "You've been using Amica since Oct 2025"
    - Audit trail (when did they change their name?)
  - Automatic: Database sets these, you don't manually update

  ---
  Questions to Consider:

  1. Should we store timezone? (for displaying times correctly)
    - My take: Not yet - adds complexity. Assume all users in same city for prototype.
  2. Should we store preferences globally? (e.g., "always vegetarian")
    - My take: Not yet - store per-response. Add in v2 if needed.
  3. What about phone number for SMS?
    - My take: Out of scope for 4 weeks. Email-only.

  ---
  Does the User table make sense? Any questions before we move to Gathering?

> Makes sense and agreed with your recommendations to descope. Question on email and UUID. If the same 
email address use the system, say sarah.chen@email.com it will be merged to just one ID (UUID) in the 
database? I assume they can use different names if they wanted to per session? 

⏺ Excellent question! You're thinking about the behavior, not just the structure. Let me clarify:

  ---
  Email + UUID Relationship

  Scenario: sarah.chen@email.com interacts twice

  First interaction (creates a gathering):
  Check database: Does email "sarah.chen@email.com" exist?
  → No
  → Create new User:
     id: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"  (generated UUID)
     email: "sarah.chen@email.com"
     name: "Sarah"

  Second interaction (RSVPs to friend's gathering):
  Check database: Does email "sarah.chen@email.com" exist?
  → Yes! Found id: "550e8400-..."
  → Reuse that User record
  → Don't create duplicate

  Result: Same email → Same UUID across all gatherings/responses

  ---
  What About the Name?

  You asked: "Can they use different names per session?"

  Two options:

  Option A: Name lives on User table (simpler)

  First time: name = "Sarah"
  Second time: they enter "Sarah Chen"
  → UPDATE User SET name = "Sarah Chen"
  → All past responses now show "Sarah Chen"

  Trade-off:
  - ✅ Simpler data model
  - ✅ Consistent identity across all gatherings
  - ❌ Can't have different names for different friend groups

  Option B: Name per Response (more flexible)

  User table: just id + email (no name)
  Response table: user_id + display_name

  Same person could be:
  - "Sarah C" in work gathering
  - "Sarah Chen" in family gathering

  Trade-off:
  - ✅ Flexibility per context
  - ❌ More complex (name scattered across responses)
  - ❌ Gathering organizer also needs name stored somewhere

  ---
  My Recommendation for Prototype:

  Go with Option A (name on User table, updates each time)

  Why:
  - Simpler to implement
  - Most people use consistent name
  - If they type "Sarah" once and "Sarah Chen" later, updating is fine
  - Edge case (wanting different names) is rare for friend gatherings

  Code behavior:
  // When user enters email + name
  const user = await findOrCreateUser({
    email: "sarah.chen@email.com",
    name: "Sarah Chen"  // Updates name if user exists
  })

  // findOrCreateUser logic:
  // 1. Find by email
  // 2. If found: update name (if different) + return existing
  // 3. If not found: create new with generated UUID

  This means:
  - ✅ Same email = same UUID forever
  - ✅ Name can change (overwrites previous)
  - ✅ Email is the permanent identifier, name is just display

  ---
  Production Consideration (Not for Prototype):

  In a real app, you might:
  - Store name on User but also display_name on Response (with default to User.name)
  - Track name changes: "Sarah updated their name from 'Sarah' to 'Sarah Chen'"
  - Let users have a "profile name" vs "display name per gathering"

  But for 4 weeks: Simple update on User table is perfect.

  ---
  Does that clarify the email-UUID-name relationship? Ready to move to the Gathering table?

> Yes, that makes sense. A user can relate to the gathering either as a host/organiser or an 
invitee/participant. Where is this informations stored? In a different database that joins gathering and 
user? Sorry, I think this should be my last question before we move on to Gathering  table 

⏺ Perfect question! You're thinking exactly like a database designer. This is about relationships between
  tables.

  ---
  How Users Relate to Gatherings

  You're right - there are two different relationships:

  1. Organizer Relationship (One-to-Many)

  Stored in: Gathering table directly

  Gathering
  ├─ id
  ├─ organizer_id  ← Foreign key pointing to User.id
  ├─ title
  └─ ...

  What this means:
  - One User can organize many Gatherings
  - Each Gathering has exactly one organizer
  - No separate table needed - just a column that references User

  Example data:
  Gathering #1: organizer_id = "550e8400..." (Sarah's UUID)
  Gathering #2: organizer_id = "550e8400..." (Sarah's UUID)
  Gathering #3: organizer_id = "abc-123..." (Bob's UUID)

  Sarah organized 2 gatherings, Bob organized 1.

  ---
  2. Participant Relationship (Many-to-Many)

  Stored in: Response table (acts as a join table)

  Response
  ├─ id
  ├─ gathering_id  ← Foreign key to Gathering
  ├─ user_id       ← Foreign key to User
  ├─ availability
  ├─ budget_max
  └─ ...

  What this means:
  - One User can respond to many Gatherings (as a participant)
  - One Gathering can have many Users responding
  - The Response table connects them + stores their preferences

  Example data:
  Response #1: gathering_id=G1, user_id=Amy, availability=[Sat]
  Response #2: gathering_id=G1, user_id=Bob, availability=[Sun]
  Response #3: gathering_id=G2, user_id=Amy, availability=[Fri]

  Amy is a participant in G1 and G2. Bob is a participant in G1.

  Visual Diagram

  User (Sarah)
    |
    | organizer_id (stored in Gathering)
    ↓
  Gathering #1 "Brunch in Melbourne"
    ↑
    | gathering_id (stored in Response)
    |
    ├─ Response (Amy)    ← user_id points back to User (Amy)
    ├─ Response (Bob)    ← user_id points back to User (Bob)
    └─ Response (Charlie)

  Sarah's role: Organizer (via Gathering.organizer_id)Amy/Bob/Charlie's role: Participants (via
  Response.user_id)

  ---
  Why Response Table = Join Table + Data

  In database design, a join table (also called "junction table") connects two tables in a many-to-many
  relationship.

  Simple join table (minimal):
  GatheringParticipant
  ├─ gathering_id
  └─ user_id

  But we need more than just "who's invited" - we need their preferences!

  So Response table is a rich join table:
  Response
  ├─ gathering_id       ← Join table part
  ├─ user_id            ← Join table part
  ├─ availability       ← Extra data
  ├─ budget_max         ← Extra data
  ├─ cuisine_prefs      ← Extra data
  └─ dietary_restrictions ← Extra data

  This is a common pattern: Join table that also carries meaningful information.

  ---
  Key Insight

  You don't need a separate table to track "who's a participant" - the existence of a Response record
  means they're a participant!

  To find all participants of Gathering #1:
  SELECT user_id FROM Response WHERE gathering_id = 'G1'

  To find all gatherings Amy participated in:
  SELECT gathering_id FROM Response WHERE user_id = 'Amy-UUID'

  ---
  Edge Case: What if someone is invited but hasn't responded yet?

  Option A (prototype approach): No Response record = not tracked
  - Organizer manually shares link, we don't pre-create invitations
  - Response only exists after they submit the form

  Option B (production approach): Separate Invitation table
  Invitation
  ├─ gathering_id
  ├─ user_id (or just email if they're not in system yet)
  └─ status: "pending" | "responded" | "declined"

  Then Response links to Invitation

  For 4 weeks: Option A is fine. We won't pre-populate invitations.

  ---
  Does the relationship structure make sense now? Ready for the Gathering table design?

> Makes sense, the nuance is one to one, one to many, where to store it and when to use a rich join table 
like the response table! Let's go into the Gathering table schema  design 

⏺ Perfect! You've got the core concept. Now let's design the heart of the system - the Gathering table.

  ---
  Table 2: Gathering

  This table represents a single coordination event - one instance of "friends trying to meet up."

  Gathering
  ├─ id                   (UUID, primary key)
  ├─ organizer_id         (UUID, foreign key → User.id)
  ├─ title                (string)
  ├─ location             (string)
  ├─ time_options         (JSON array)
  ├─ rsvp_deadline        (timestamp)
  ├─ status               (enum: "collecting" | "completed" | "failed")
  ├─ agent_output         (JSON, nullable)
  ├─ created_at           (timestamp)
  └─ updated_at           (timestamp)

  ---
  Field-by-Field Breakdown:

  id - UUID
  - Same pattern as User
  - Used in shareable links: https://amica.app/g/abc-123...
  - Non-guessable for privacy

  organizer_id - UUID, Foreign Key → User.id
  - What: References the User who created this gathering
  - Why foreign key?
    - Database enforces: Can't have organizer_id that doesn't exist in User table
    - Can't delete a User if they've organized gatherings (protects data integrity)
  - Relationship: One-to-Many
    - One User can organize many Gatherings
    - Each Gathering has exactly one organizer
  - How it's used:
    - Display "Sarah's brunch gathering"
    - Determine who can edit/cancel the gathering

  title - String
  - What: Human-friendly name ("Brunch in Melbourne", "Team dinner")
  - Why needed?
    - Multiple gatherings can be in same location ("Melbourne")
    - Organizer might create 2 brunches different weekends
    - Shows in email/notifications: "You're invited to: Team dinner"

  location - String
  - What: Search area for venues ("Brunswick, VIC", "Downtown Seattle")
  - Why string, not structured address?
    - Flexibility: User might type "near my office" or "South Melbourne"
    - Agent + Google Places API can geocode it
    - Don't need precision for search radius
  - Prototype simplicity: Just text input
  - Production upgrade: Could use Google Places Autocomplete widget → store place_id

  time_options - JSON Array
  - What: Array of possible times/dates organizer offers
  - Example: ["Sat 11 Oct 10am-12pm", "Sun 12 Oct 10am-12pm"]
  - Why JSON instead of separate TimeOption table?

  - Option A (separate table):
  TimeOption
  ├─ id
  ├─ gathering_id
  └─ time_slot (string)
    - More "normalized" (database design principle)
    - Query: "Give me all time options for gathering X"

  Option B (JSON array - what we're doing):
  time_options: ["Sat 11 Oct", "Sun 12 Oct"]
    - Simpler: Always loaded with Gathering (1 query not 2)
    - Time options don't have their own lifecycle (never edit just one)
    - Lightweight for prototype

  Trade-off: Less queryable ("find all gatherings on Saturday") but we don't need that query.

  rsvp_deadline - Timestamp
  - What: When to stop waiting for responses and run the agent
  - Why needed?
    - Trigger logic: if (all_responded OR now > deadline) → run agent
    - Prevents gathering from hanging indefinitely if 1 person never responds
    - User sets: "I need recommendations by Friday evening"
  - Example: 2025-10-10T18:00:00Z (Oct 10, 6pm UTC)
  - How agent uses it:
    - Cron job checks every hour: "Are there gatherings past deadline with status='collecting'?"
    - If yes → trigger agent even if not everyone responded

  status - Enum (limited set of values)
  - What: Current state of the gathering in the workflow
  - Possible values:
    - "collecting" - Waiting for responses
    - "completed" - Agent ran successfully, recommendations ready
    - "failed" - Agent encountered error
  - Why enum vs string?
    - Database enforces valid values (can't accidentally set status="done" instead of "completed")
    - Type-safe in code (TypeScript knows exactly which values are valid)
  - How it drives the app:
  if status === "collecting":
    → Show "2/5 people responded, waiting for others..."

  if status === "completed":
    → Show agent recommendations

  if status === "failed":
    → Show "Something went wrong, please review responses"
  - State transitions:
  Creating gathering → status = "collecting"
  Last response received → status = "completed" (after agent runs)
  Agent crashes → status = "failed"

  agent_output - JSON, Nullable
  - What: The agent's final recommendations (stored as structured data)
  - Why JSON?
    - Agent returns complex nested data:
    {
    "preference_analysis": {
      "budget_range": { "min": 20, "max": 30 },
      "consensus_cuisines": ["Italian", "Japanese"],
      "availability": "Sunday 10am-12pm"
    },
    "venue_recommendations": [
      {
        "name": "Nicholson St Roasters",
        "address": "131 Sydney Rd, Coburg",
        "rating": 4.4,
        "price_level": 2,
        "match_score": 0.92,
        "reasoning": "Matches budget, has vegetarian options..."
      },
      {...}, {...}
    ]
  }
    - Flexible structure (agent output might evolve)
    - Frontend can parse and display however it wants
  - Why nullable?
    - When status="collecting" → agent_output is null (hasn't run yet)
    - When status="completed" → agent_output has data
    - When status="failed" → might be null or contain error info
  - Prototype simplification:
    - Could store in separate VenueRecommendation table
    - But JSON on Gathering is simpler for 4 weeks
    - Easy to evolve to separate table later if needed

  created_at / updated_at - Timestamps
  - Auto-managed by database
  - Useful for:
    - Sorting: "Show most recent gatherings first"
    - Debugging: "When was this created vs when did responses come in?"
    - Cleanup: "Delete gatherings older than 30 days"

  Design Decisions Explained

  Why JSON for time_options and agent_output?

  Pros:
  - ✅ Flexible schema (agent output structure can change)
  - ✅ Fewer tables (simpler joins)
  - ✅ Atomic operations (load everything in 1 query)
  - ✅ Fast for prototype

  Cons:
  - ❌ Can't query inside JSON easily ("find gatherings with Italian in recommendations")
  - ❌ No schema validation at database level (could store any JSON)
  - ❌ If JSON gets huge, slow to load

  For Amica: Pros outweigh cons. These fields are:
  - Loaded as a unit (always need full array/object)
  - Not frequently queried by content
  - Reasonably sized (time_options: ~5 items, agent_output: ~3 venues)

  Why status enum instead of booleans?

  Bad approach:
  is_collecting (boolean)
  is_completed (boolean)
  is_failed (boolean)
  Problems: Could have is_collecting=true AND is_completed=true (invalid state!)

  Good approach (enum):
  status = "collecting" | "completed" | "failed"
  - Mutually exclusive (can only be in one state)
  - Easy to add states later ("pending_approval", "cancelled")
  - Clear state transitions

  ---
  Questions to Consider:

  1. Should we store invitee emails on Gathering?
  invited_emails: ["amy@email.com", "bob@email.com"]
    - My take: Not for prototype. We know invitees from Response table.
    - Production: Maybe, to track "invited but haven't responded yet"
  2. Should we store participant_count explicitly?
  expected_participants: 5
    - My take: No, can calculate from Response count
    - Avoids "source of truth" problem (what if count doesn't match actual responses?)
  3. Should status include "cancelled"?
    - My take: Yes, add it! "collecting" | "completed" | "failed" | "cancelled"
    - Organizer should be able to cancel

  ---
  Does the Gathering table structure make sense? Any questions before we design the Response table?

> Yes, that all makes sense. Thanks for talking me through the pros and cons of json approach. As for 
questions to consider, agree with you for the 3 recommendations, esp the cancelled status. Let's go to the
